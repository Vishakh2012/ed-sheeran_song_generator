that state of mind\nLearned to sing inside the Lords house, but stopped the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the worlds against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that Ive got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point, I know without its no fun\nI need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what Ive become\nGuess its a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nShow me the locked doors, Ill find another use for the key\nAnd youll see\nIm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here Ill stay\nSave your lovin arms for a rainy day\nAnd Ill find comfort in my pain eraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell\nRelationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd aint nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause youre living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that Im not trying to preach like Im Reverend Run\nI beg you, dont be disappointed with the man Ive become\nConversations with my father on the A14\nAge 12 telling me Ive gotta chase those dreams\nNow Im playing for the people, dad, and they know me\nWith my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowds 240 thou\nI may have grown up, but I hope that Damians proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspirations allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\nIm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one

Mulligan\nAnd I was William Sheeran\nShe took my name and then we were one\nDown by the Wexford border\nWell, I met her at Guys in the second World War\nAnd she was working on a soldiers ward\nNever had I seen such beauty before\nThe moment that I saw her\nNancy was my yellow rose\nAnd we got married wearing borrowed clothes\nWe got eight children, now growing old\nFive sons and three daughters\nShe and I went on the run\nDont care about religion\nIm gonna marry the woman I love\nDown by the Wexford border\nShe was Nancy Mulligan\nAnd I was William Sheeran\nShe took my name and then we were one\nDown by the Wexford border\nFrom her snow white streak in her jet black hair\nOver sixty years Ive been loving her\nNow were sat by the fire in our old armchairs\nYou know Nancy, I adore ya\nFrom a farm boy born near Belfast town\nI never worried about the king and crown\nCause I found my heart upon the southern ground\nTheres no difference, I assure ya\nShe and I went on the run\nDont care about religion\nIm gonna marry the woman I love\nDown by the Wexford border\nShe was Nancy Mulligan\nAnd I was William Sheeran\nShe took my name and then we were one\nDown by the

who is it, whos in it or what the hell does it matter?\nChitter chatter, dont matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it dont matter to me\nAll I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely\nTo be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?\nHey, so I keep singing that\nWhen I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters\nBecame invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar\nAnd made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark\nAnd then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody\nHennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block\nWho said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?\nIm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy\nWith my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die\nSo see the signs, stand to the side\nOpen your eyes and take a look and realize\nThe resurrections arrived and as the mist clears\nI arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar\nUrban Angel rising from the ashes\nSurprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady\nYou can find me in the club, bottle full of bub\nMummy Ive got the X if youre into taking drugs\nInto having sex, I aint into making

none, youre celibate\nMy flows developing, skin lacks the melanin\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\nDo it for the hell of it\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit\nI took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image\nPut in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick\nThe fact is this, Ill end up dating actresses\nWake up on dirty mattresses, I think Ill need to practice this\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\nWorlds on my shoulders, I dont even know what Atlas is\nHard bars sharp like a cactus is\nIm back to

genre pretty basic\nAnd Ill be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nInto another rapper shoes using new laces\nIm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the mustache\nI hit back, when the pen hurts me\nIm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nIm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though\nAccording to the MySpace and YouTube videos\nIm always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio\nMelody music maker, reading all the papers\nThey say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator\nCause

Lyrics\nSaid Id never leave her cause her hands fit like my t-shirt\nTongue tied over three words, cursed\nRunning over thoughts that make my feet hurt\nBodies intertwined with her lips\nNow shes feeling so low since she went solo\nHole in the middle of my heart like a Polo\nAnd its no joke to me\nSo can we do it all over again?\nIf youre pretending from the start like this with a tight grip\nThen my kiss can mend your broken heart\nI might miss everything you said to me\nAnd I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this\nAnd I will give you all my heart\nSo we can start it all over again\nCan we take the same road\nTwo days in the same clothes\nAnd I know just what shell say if I can make all this pain go\nCan we stop this for a minute?\nYou know, I can tell that your heart isnt in it or with it\nTell me with your mind, body and spirit\nI can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British\nWhether were together or apart\nWe can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start\nIf youre pretending from the start like this with a tight grip\nThen my kiss can mend your broken heart\nI might miss everything you said to me\nAnd I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this\nAnd I will give you all my heart\nSo we can start it all over again\nYoull never know how to make it on your own\nAnd youll never show weakness for letting go\nI guess its still hard if the seeds sown\nBut do you really want to be alone?\nIf youre pretending from the start like this\nWith a tight grip, then my kiss\nCan mend your broken heart\nI might miss everything you said to me\nAnd I can lend you broken parts\nThat might fit like this\nAnd I will give you all my heart\nSo we can start it all over again\nIf youre pretending from the start like this with a tight grip\nThen my kiss can mend your broken heart\nI might miss everything you said to me\nAnd I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this\nAnd I will give you all my heart\nSo

low\nBecause if you want, Ill take you in my arms and keep you sheltered\nFrom all that Ive done wrong\nAnd Ill know youll say that Im the only one\nBut I know God made another one of me\nTo love you

ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in\nI never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden\nWatch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision\nSigned to a label but didnt listen to any criticism\nThought you knew but you didnt, so perk your ears up and listen\nStudio is a system and you could say that Im driven\nAnd now its onto the next saga, we drink the best lager\nIll never try to win you over like your stepfather\nIll do my own thing now and get respect after\nAnd Im avoiding the caine like it was Get Carter\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\nBut its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\nAt 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked\nAnd went from sleeping at a subway station\nTo sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\nNot my imagination, I dont wanna relax\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? Ill take it back now\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back, love\nNo\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack, Ill be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school\nIll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes\nIll give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again thats what theyre supposed to do\nAnd Im supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering, Everything that happens is from now on\nIll be ready to start again by the end of the song\nAnd still theyre claiming that I handle it wrong\nBut then Ive never had an enemy except the NME\nBut Ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazinesll ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nIm battling for respect, and I dont know if Ill have it\nThis songs from the heart, covered the planet, Ill take it back now\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back, love\nNo, Ill take it back now\nNow, I dont ever wanna be perfect\nCause Im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someones gotta win worst-dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change, thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\nCause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly, need to let my liver be\nAnd Ill say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends\nIts good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\nCause thats how its supposed to be, Im screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams, but\nBut I just write schemes\nIm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely\nYoull find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that well never betray\nThe way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down\nThats how we plan it out, its time to take it back now\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back, love\nNo\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back, love\nNo\nMy dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme\nTill I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?\nWith this you must know that the numbers just sold\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 percent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 percent, it never fades\nDreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads\nTried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade\nOh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago I couldnt just control that thought\nYoud find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors\nNow Im sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit\nYou cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nIm not a rapper, Im a singer, I just take the piss\nAnd most of these other guys are kids that pose\nHis little sister has to babysit, thats just the way it is\nDreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it\nTread your own path, youll never make it as a follower\nYoull never know where you will go or you will be

ringing a bell\nSometimes I wonder, in any other summer\nCould you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?\nUnder the covers where we used to lay\nAnd RE: Stacks is what the speakers played\nId be on tour almost every day\nWhen I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay\nJust watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed\nGetting high as two kites when we needed to breathe\nWe used each others air just for the people to see\nAnd stay up all night like when we needed to sleep\nWe go anywhere, our minds would take us\nAnd Ill say you are beautiful without your make-up\nAnd you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause\nWe can all be loved the way that God made us\nAnd times the only reason that we could break up\nCause you would always tell me Im away too much\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes\nTo get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I aint never coming home, Nina\nOh, wont you leave me now?\nAnd Ive been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that’s you and me both, Nina\nOh, wont you leave me now, now?\nAnd every weekend in the winter youd be wearing my hoodie\nWith drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold\nTaking day trips to the local where wed eat on our own\nCause every day when I was away wed only speak on the phone\nWatching Blue Planet, creating new habits\nActing as if we were two rabbits and then youd vanish\nBack to the burrow with all the Celtics\nI disappear, you call me selfish\nI understand but I can’t help it\nI put my job over everything except my family and friends\nBut youll be in between forever so I guess well have to take a step back\nOverlook the situation\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\nAnd Im not saying we should be taking a break\nJust re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late\nSo we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane\nBut in a day well have to say it again\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I aint never coming home, Nina\nOh, wont you leave me now?\nAnd Ive been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that’s you and me both, Nina\nOh, wont you leave me now, now?\nLove will come and love will go\nBut you cant make it on your own\nSing that song, go\nOh wont you leave me now?\nPeople grow and fall apart\nBut you cant mend your broken heart\nTake it back, go\nOh wont you leave me now?\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I aint never coming home, Nina\nOh,

just the worst way to spend your birthday, its 30 degrees, Thursday\nYou work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes\nLady, the word rape sums up events that take place every night\nYou wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try\nAnd you remember that your punter went crazy last night\nYou drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry\nForget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for\nYoull make a trip to the Whittington where theyll look at your jaw\nTheyll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure\nTheyll know youre fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door\nBut young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker\nMedical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldnt\nEver let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him\nCause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in\nShes just under the upper hand\nAnd goes mad for a couple grams\nAnd she dont wanna go outside, tonight\nCause, in a pipe, shell fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIts too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nLittle lady, your mind youve made up\nYour injuries you cant hide with make-up\nYou need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just\nIn case the doc opens his eyes and dont decide to play dumb\nWith any luck youll see the same dude who stitched your top lip\nLast year when your pimp just lost it\nHe wouldnt recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway\nCause all the heroin is making you age\nBut youre a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag\nThe funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram\nMother had to get you out the motherland to study\nThat was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand\nLittle does she know youre never coming back\nShe put you in her brothers hands, only for him to formulate another plan\nHes the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer\nFancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn\nShes just under the upper hand\nAnd goes mad for a couple grams\nAnd she dont wanna go outside, tonight\nCause, in a pipe, shell fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIts too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nNow an angel will die, covered in white\nWith closed eyes and hoping for a better life\nThis time now, well fade out tonight\nStraight down the line\nLittle lady, youre trembling with fear\nYour skinny frame kinda resembles a deer\nYoure sitting facing the detective, oh, dear\nThe meddling nurse couldnt just leave it\nShes only gone and made it much worse calling police in\nShell never know the gravity of the damage shes caused\nYoure causing scandal going mad in the ward now\nThe cop is trying to calm you, telling you he wont let no one harm you\nThe same question he keeps trying to ask you, Who you working for?\nHes talking to you like youre worth more than a dirty whore\nYoure having a conversation you could be murdered for\nYoure learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court\nHes kicking knowledge you aint ever heard before\nJust before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that its hard\nHe underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card\nBegs you to use it, hes useless if youre gonna be stupid\nCause an answer hasnt come from your bruised lips, youre on your own\nYouve gotta go and give your pimp what you owe\nYou reach your door and then it dawns that youve been followed home\nBefore you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat\nAnd then a voice says, Where you been, bitch? I wanna know\nNo prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nTheres something new in him, hes silent now, that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point, your life flashes before your eyes\nYour handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess theres only one thing that has caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday\nAnd were all under the upper hand\nAnd going mad for a couple grams\nAnd we dont wanna go outside, tonight\nCause, in a pipe, shell fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIts too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nAnd fly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo

be?\nHope she knows that I found a man far from my father\nSam, my baby, and me\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nAnd I hope Im as brave as my mother\nWondering what kind of mother

growing, so I cut it with a vengeance\nHey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?\nSaid I had a tendency to finish off a sentence\nOh well, she’s a local girl\nNo make-up cause she knows me well\nHair tied up in elastic band\nWith a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man\nIts like the fast food, I’ll regret it after\nAnd I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her\nSo she buys me chips and cheese\nAnd I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need\nI take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley\nShe’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi\nHeading to the party, sitting in the car seat\nB.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly\nShe knows me well\nBit of a catch to have a local girl\nHair tied up in elastic band\nWith a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man\nI don’t wanna go alone\nI don’t wanna go alone\nNo, I dont wanna go alone\nTell her that I love her, tell her that I need her\nTell her that she’s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\nAll I wanna do is be near\nTell her that I want her, tell her that I need her\nTell her that she’s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that I love her more than anyone else\nIf you don’t, I’ll tell her myself\nAnd we’ve got that love in us and were the drink killers\nWe’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers\nIf we talk outside, say Hey whats new?\nI don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you\nAre you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright\nI don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type\nTell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing\nShe said I wanna take off what you’re wearing\nShe’s like the fast food, I’ll regret it after\nAnd I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her\nBut she buys me chips and cheese\nSo I tell her that she’s all I need\nTell her that I, tell her that I\nTell her that she’s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\nAll I wanna do is be near\nTell her that I, tell her that I\nTell her that she’s more than a one-night stand\nTell

left\nExcept for the last twenty sack\nAnd the last twenty of my last cheque\nI took a pill and went to sleep on the last step\nWoke up and took it in with a half breath\nThen a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick\nI lit my cigarette, feeling half dead\nWhisky on my mind, then came the debt\nSheriff in the yard, here comes the rest\nI sat like a ghost, they all passed by\nMy girl cried baby this’ll be my last bye\nBaby in her arms, she took a cab home\nShe told me I was only good for a sad song\nA crooked smile I gave, nonchalant about it\nMaybe she’ll come back, this time I doubt it\nAct like I care, but I really don’t\nWanted to change but somehow I knew I really won’t\nSee I’m the type of man who can’t stay out the bottle\nIf the sun is out I’d rather be in the shadow\nSadness is like a wound that I can’t heal\nMaybe I love blood, I just let it spill\nAnd I never turned to church for a praying hand\nGod’s not going to lend another saving hand\nIf the time came like it has time again\nThen I would watch the clock, and be late again\nOne gun and a harley in the driveway\nOne way out, dirt road pathway\nPut another dead butt in the ash tray\nI stand up still drunk, half baked\nCover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring\nAnd through the fence I can see this little boy staring\nPaid him no attention, in fact I barely seen him\nUntil he walked away, and he started singing…\nLondon Bridge is falling down, falling down\nAnd if it don’t stop falling, then all of us will drown\nThen we’ll crash, crash, right down again\nOh we’ll crash, crash, right down again\nI didn’t see it coming, I didn’t see the wall\nAnd I went from running to a slow crawl\nI feel like I’m a child, but I’m afraid to cry\nWould say I’m okay, but I’m afraid to lie\nI speak no evil, but hear no angels\nMy family is callin’, but all I see is strangers\nTake the bible from the hotel drawer\nHell froze over, ice cold, hell’s door, knock-knock,\nI’m on the salt road non-stop\nThe exit I will pass ’cause the sign did rot\nIn the gust of a dry summer\nDirty water in the tap, I think I found my number in the sand\nRight next to an empty can\nOld number seven, Jack is back again\nAnd the voice goes round and round\nAnd I would take the bridge but I can’t forget the sound\nLondon Bridge is falling down, falling down\nAnd if it don’t stop falling, then all of us will drown\nThen we’ll crash, crash, right down again\nOh we’ll crash, crash, right down again\nI’ll be coming up when the sun goes down\nRollin like a rock till I hit the ground\nRunning from the law but I can’t be found\nOnly my God can track me down\nI’ll be coming up when the sun goes down\nRollin like a rock till I hit the ground\nRunning from the law but I can’t be found\nOnly my God can

amazin’ sons\nJust yesterday, they had both, now they raisin one\nI look at the clouds and just think\nI could lose mine, or they could lose me in one blink\nWhen I think one day it all ends, I start to drink\nAnd fathom suicide, cause I was almost on the brink\nAnd it feel like my family been jinxed\nEver since I found my grandmother stiff\nLeanin over the kitchen sink\nI could cry enough tears

learn a lesson until you go through it?\nHow come you can think about the past, but cant go to it?\nIf I could, I would float through it\nWalk up to Triple X’s BMW window and stick a note to it\nTell him to drive off, the Devil comin\nEver since he fell from Heaven, he been tryin to settle somethin\nI keep the faith and try not to question God\nBut I got a problem when I see innocent people die\nI sympathize with Jews, I sympathize with blacks\nSympathize with Natives, America’s yours if you want it back\nWhere the hunger at?\nProbably under a tree in Mississippi by the river where they hung us at\nIf Jesus walked, why we all runnin laps?\nFeel like endin racism further than where the sun is at\nA wall to keep people from people, how dumb is that?\nI guess we shouldnt put our thoughts on the front of hats\nI got lost on the roadside\nYeah, I lost my way\nI give thanks to the Most High\nCause he kept me safe\nHope to God that I dont die\nSo I pray\nIf I go, mama, dont cry\nI was on the

Youve seen the Army of the Dead. Youve seen the Night King. Hes coming for us. For all of us.\nEDD pauses and looks down, then looks to his men.\nEDD: Okay, come on. Lets get them inside.\nTwo Nights Watch men sheathe their swords, approach BRANs sled, grab the ropes, and pull him inside the gate. MEERA follows. EDD lingers and stares out into the wild, then turns on his heel and walks through the gate. The gate closes behind him.INT. WINTERFELL - MAIN HALLJON SNOW stands at the high table. SANSA and DAVOS sit at his sides. BRIENNE, PODRIC, TORMUND, PETYR BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, and the lords of the northern houses are in attendance.\nJON: I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. Its more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.\nROBETT: Its about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.\nThe northern lords laugh.\nJON: Not just the boys.\nBRIENNE looks at JON.\nJON: We cant defend the North if only half the population is fighting.\nROBETT stands.\nROBETT: You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughters hand?\nLYANNA stands.\nLYANNA: I dont plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.\nROBETT: Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--\nLYANNA: And I dont need your permission to defend the North.\nDAVOS smiles. LYANNA turns to JON.\nLYANNA: Well begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.\nThe men pound their tables and shout in agreement. ROBETT nods at LYANNA. ROBETT and LYANNA sit.\nJON: While were preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries. Im not the king of the Free Folk.\nJON looks at TORMUND. TORMUND turns and looks at JON.\nJON: But if were going to survive this winter together...\nTORMUND grunts and stands.\nTORMUND: You want us to man the castles for you?\nThe men murmur.\nJON: Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\nTORMUND: Then thats where Ill go. Looks like were the Nights Watch now.\nTORMUND sits.\nJON: If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.\nYOHN stands.\nYOHN: The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.\nSANSA: The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.\nALL: Aye!\nYOHN sits.\nJON: The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. Theyve kept faith for generation after generation.\nSANSA: And then they broke faith.\nJON: Im not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.\nSANSA: So theres no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?\nThe hall goes silent.\nJON: The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.\nSANSA: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.\nThe men chatter and pound the tables.\nJON: When I was Lord Commander of the Nights Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his fathers sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.\nJON stares at SANSA. SANSA looks away. JON addresses the hall.\nJON: Ned Umber.\nNED UMBER, a boy, stands.\nJON: Alys Karstark.\nALYS KARSTARK, a young woman, stands. NED and ALYS approach the high table.\nJON: For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.\nNED and ALYS unsheathe their swords and kneel.\nJON: Stand.\nNED and ALYS stand.\nJON: Yesterdays wars dont matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?\nNED & ALYS: Now and always!\nThe men cheer and pound the tables.\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - WALKWAY\nJON walks briskly along the walkway. SANSA follows him.\nJON: You are my sister, but I am king now.\nSANSA: Will you start wearing a crown?\nJON: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.\nSANSA: So I cant question your decisions anymore?\nJON: Of course you can, but--\nSANSA: Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?\nJON stops walking. SANSA walks past him, then stops and turns to face him.\nJON: Do you think Im Joffrey?\nSANSA: Youre as far from Joffrey as anyone Ive ever met.\nJON: Thank you.\nJON stares out at the yard below.\nSANSA: Youre good at this, you know.\nJON: At what?\nSANSA: At ruling.\nJON sighs.\nJON: No.\nSANSA: You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--\nJON chuckles.\nSANSA: Why are you laughing?\nJON continues walking. SANSA follows.\nJON: What did father used to say? Everything before the word but is horse shit.\nSANSA: He never said that to me.\nJON: No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.\nSANSA: Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldnt protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.\nJON: All right, Ill stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.\nSANSA: Im not trying to undermine you.\nSANSA grabs JONs arm and spins him to face her.\nSANSA: You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.\nJON: And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?\nSANSA: Would that be so terrible?\nMAESTER WOLKAN approaches.\nWOLKAN: A raven from Kings Landing, Your Grace.\nWOLKAN hands a bound note to JON, then bows and leaves. JON unravels the note.\nJON: Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--\nSANSA: What does she want?\nJON: Come to Kings Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.\nSANSA: Youve been so consumed with the enemy to the north, youve forgotten about the one to the south.\nJON: Im consumed with the Night King because Ive seen him. And believe me, youd think of little else if you had, too.\nSANSA: We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.\nJON: Theres a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. Theyve never ranged this far north.\nSANSA: Youre the military man, but I know her. If youre her enemy, shell never stop until shes destroyed you. Everyone whos ever crossed her, shes found a way to murder.\nJON: You almost sound as if you admire her.\nSANSA: I learned a great deal from her.EXT. KINGS LANDING - RED KEEP COURTYARDCERSEI walks atop a mural of Westeros painted on the floor. The painter is completing it. JAIME enters and walks towards CERSEI, then looks at the mural and nods at the painter. The painter puts down his brush and exits.\nJAIME: What is this?\nCERSEI: Its what weve been waiting for our whole lives. Its what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.\nJAIME: He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.\nCERSEI: Its ours now, we just have to take it.\nCERSEI turns to face JAIME.\nCERSEI: Youve been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?\nJAIME: No, not angry.\nCERSEI: Are you afraid of me?\nJAIME: Should I be?\nCERSEI: Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, theyre sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her fathers throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. Hes out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?\nJAIME: Dragonstone.\nJAIME approaches the depiction of Dragonstone in the mural and stands over it.\nJAIME: They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and thats where she was born.\nCERSEI: Enemies to the east.\nCERSEI walks towards Dorne on the mural.\nCERSEI: Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.\nCERSEI walks towards Highgarden on the mural.\nCERSEI: Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.\nCERSEi walks towards the North on the mural.\nCERSEI: Enemies to the north. Ned Starks bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. Were surrounded by traitors. Youre in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?\nJAIME: Winter is here. We cant win a war if we cant feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.\nCERSEI: Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?\nJAIME: If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.\nCERSEI: Im the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\nJAIME: Three kingdoms, at best. Im not sure you understand how much danger were in.\nCERSEI: I understand were in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.\nJAIME: A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. Were the last of us.\nCERSEI: A dynasty for us, then.\nJAIME: We never talked about Tommen.\nCERSEi turns and walks to a nearby table and pours herself a glass of wine.\nCERSEI: Theres nothing to say.\nJAIME: Our baby boy killed himself.\nCERSEI: He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?\nJAIME: Cersei--\nCERSEI: I loved them. I did. But theyre ashes now and were still flesh and blood. Were the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.\nJAIME: Even Lannisters cant survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.\nCERSEI: I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?\nJAIME: We couldnt. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now theyre all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We cant win this war alone.\nCERSEI: You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?\nCUT TO: KINGS LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY\nShips bearing the kraken sigil of House Greyjoy are sailing into port. CERSEI and JAIME watch the boats from the shore, escorted by GREGOR CLEGANE and several other guards.\nJAIME: The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to Kings Landing?\nCERSEI: Not all of them.\nJAIME: Well, it looks like all of them.\nCERSEI: I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.\nJAIME: How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.\nCERSEI: So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And theyre good at killing.\nJAIME: Theyre not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. Theyre bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they cant build or grow themselves.\nCERSEI: Euron Greyjoy didnt come here for that.\nJAIME: Oh, what did he come here for, then?\nCERSEI: A queen.\nCERSEI exits, followed by GREGOR and the guards.\nCUT TO: KINGS LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL\nCERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, flanked by JAIME and GREGOR. EURON GREYJOY stands at the foot of the throne. Guards line the hall.\nEURON: The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.\nEURON points at CERSEI.\nEURON: Its nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.\nEURON starts walking up towards the throne. GREGOR takes a step towards him. EURON stops walking and looks up at him.\nJAIME: Youre not a rightful monarch, though, are you?\nEURON smiles and walks backwards off the steps. GREGOR returns to his previous position.\nJAIME: The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, werent you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.\nEURON: I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didnt believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance.\nJAIME: The people I was cutting down were your own kin.\nEURON: The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.\nJAIME: And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.\nEURON: A good thing for me. If you hadnt crushed us, I wouldnt have gone into exile. If I hadnt done that, I wouldnt be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.\nCERSEI: If not the most humble.\nEURON: Youre not humble. Youre the queen of a great nation. You dont care about the Iron Islands. Theyre nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, thats something else entirely. Its the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.\nCERSEI: What do you want in return?\nEURON: Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.\nEURON raises his arms. JAIMEs face twists.\nCERSEI: I decline your proposal.\nEURON: Why?\nCERSEI: Youre not trustworthy. Youve broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.\nEURON: You should try it. Feels wonderful.\nEURON chuckles. JAIME looks at CERSEI.\nEURON: I dont expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I wont return to Kings Landing until I have that for you.\nEURON turns and exits the Great Hall.INT.

He hears a chain rattling, hurries to a bookshelf,\nand pretends to be placing a book on it. A maester comes around the corner, walks down past him to the gate, unlocks it, enters, and locks it behind him. SAM watches him.\nCUT TO: OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTERS LAB\nARCHMAESTER MARWYN is performing an autopsy. SAM stands on the other side of the table, watching.\nMARWYN: Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinkers liver if ever I saw one.\nMARWYN removes the liver and hands it to SAM.\nMARWYN: Weigh that.\nSAM walks over to the scales.\nMARWYN: The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankinds curse.\nSAM puts the liver on one side of the scale and places weights on the other side.\nSAM: Archmaester, I was wondering...\nMARWYN: Whats the weight?\nSAM: Um, 147.\nMARWYN walks over to an open ledger, picks up a quill, and writes the number 147.\nSAM: I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.\nMARWYN: I dont remember your proposition.\nSAM: I asked you if, in light of what Ive seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.\nMARWYN: That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?\nSAM: No.\nMARWYN: Not a very strong proposition, is it?\nMARWYN hands SAM the heart. SAM takes it to the scales.\nSAM: Archmaester, with respect, Ive seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.\nMARWYN: Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. Its their job. But the tales of the Long Night cant be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.\nSAM: Sources in the restricted area?\nMARWYN: The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that youre telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.\nSAM: So, you believe me.\nMARWYN: I do. Youll finish weighing that heart?\nSAM: That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.\nMARWYN: Were not lie the people south of the Twins. And were not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worlds memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Dont remember any meal but the last, cant see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like youre gone forever. When Roberts Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. How will we survive? When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--The end is near! How will we survive? And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasnt. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all.

The men turn to look at her. One stands.\nARYA: Thats a pretty song. Ive never heard it before.\nMAN: Its a new one.\nMAN #2: Are you hungry? Weve got some rabbit.\nARYA: I dont want to steal your food.\nMAN #3: Youre not stealing, were offering. Come on, its gonna be a cold night.\nARYA dismounts her horse, leads it nearer to the fire, and ties it reigns off on a tree. She approaches the camp.\nMAN #3: You heading south?\nARYA: Kings Landing.\nMAN #2: Poor girl.\nThe men chuckle.\nARYA: Not so bad, is it?\nMAN #3: Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pigs blood, its the town for you.\nThe men chuckle.\nMAN #2: All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldnt let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelors blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.\nMAN #3: The people who live there, theyd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide.\nMAN: Worst place in the world.\nARYA: What are you doing in the Riverlands?\nMAN #3: Theres been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so were part of the army thats been sent to keep the peace.\nMAN #2: Here you go.

Theyll be singing about us for a thousand years.\nThe men laugh.\nMAN #3; The truth is when we left home, we couldnt wait to get away.

You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?\nThe men laugh.\nMAN #3: I hope its a girl.\nARYA: Why?\nMAN #3: Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone elses wars.\nMAN #2: Are you old enough to drink?\nARYA nods. MAN #2 passes a skin of wine to ARYA. She uncorks it and drinks.\nMAN #2: Its blackberry wine.

You want some rum?\nTHOROS holds out a skin of rum to SANDOR.\nSANDOR: Dont like that shit.

No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.\nBERIC urges his horse onward. The others follow.\nSANDOR: I dont like the look of it.\nTHOROS dismounts his horse.\nTHOROS: For a big, hard man, you scare easy.\nSANDOR: Ill tell you what doesnt scare me: bald cocksuckers like you. You think youre fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt.\nTHOROS smiles.\nTHOROS: Come on. Maybe theyve got some ale hidden away.\nSANDOR: They dont.\nCUT TO: RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE \nSome of the Brothers enter the farmhouse, followed by THOROS.\nTHOROS: See if theres a larder. They always leave something behind.\nThe Brothers rummage around the farmhouse. SANDOR enters.\nHe stares at two skeletons in the corner, one adult-sized and the other child-sized. BERIC enters, sees the skeletons, and walks up beside SANDOR.\nBERIC: How do you think it ended for them?\nSANDOR: With death.\nBERIC: Girl died in her fathers arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. Id say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them.\nSANDOR: Doesnt matter now.\nBERIC: No, doesnt matter now.\nSANDOR sits at the table. BERIC joins him. SANDOR bites into a hunk of bread. THOROS starts a fire in the fireplace.\nSANDOR: Ive known you a long time, Dondarrion.\nBERIC: Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--\nSANDOR: And I always thought you were dull as dirt.\nBERIC chuckles.\nSANDOR: Youre not bad. I dont hate you. Dont like, but youre not bad.\nBERIC: Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart.\nSANDOR: But theres nothing special about you.\nBERIC: Youre right about that.\nSANDOR: So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? Ive met better men than you, and theyve been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?\nBERIC: You think I dont ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?\nSANDOR: And?\nBERIC: I dont know. I dont understand our Lord.\nSANDOR: Your Lord.\nBERIC: I dont know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.\nSANDOR: If hes so all-powerful, why doesnt he just tell you what the fuck he wants?\nTHOROS: Clegane.\nSANDOR looks at THOROS, who is kneeling by the fire.\nTHOROS: Come over here.

G sitting on the wall\nHad a gun in his bag on the way from school\nI told him, If you get life youre a fool\nThen he said something that stuck with me\nHe said, Id rather do life, than have none at all\nHe said, Krept, you made it out fam, youre cool\nHe said Me, I slip once, then Im through\nYoud do the same if you was in my shoes\nI said, Bro, Im just tryna keep you alive\nIm sick of funerals, another suit and tie\nHow do you expect me to tell a young G\nPut down the guns? That could be suicide\nFor him its kill or be killed, fam its do or die\nHe said, Krept, I dont even like this stuff\nBut Im in too deep, Im kinda fucked\nI cant think straight when man are tryna line me up\nJust visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didnt do shit\nHe said, Krept, whats good, hows the music?\nDidnt wanna gass it up too much\nYou know hes stuck doing life, he might lose it\nWishing he was out living life for the movement\nWhen the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail Brap, thats my niggas\nHappy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us\nMan this cold world could be so vicious\nPut your hands together and pray with us\nNeed to see my family more\nSo busy that they probably think that I dont love em\nProbably telling people I forgot about my cousins\nHes gone to Hollywood now, man so fuck him\nMan Im stuck\nStuck between a rock and a hard place\nCalling it overthinking, obviously\nHow can I do it if I try?\nI should have known it from the last time\nOne can dream\nCaught up in the same things is giving me life\nOne can dream\nMy mind will erase these memories, say goodbye\nIn New York I met my big sis for the first time, imagine that\nIm 24, its the first time she sees me\nBefore he died, promised dad that shed meet me\nI know it aint been easy, and I cant stay for the whole night\nShe hugged me with tears in her eyes\nAnd said she wished that he still was alive\nShe said, your mum sent you Jamaica\nShe told me you came back ill\nYeah I know you aint been back still\nBut you know your friend over there got killed\nI know she always had love for me\nThen she said something that stuck with me\nDad said you gotta keep the music alive\nThen she gave the the look like its up to me\nIt hit me hard, didnt show it though\nThinking bout it on the plane, going home\nGrowing up without my dad ever round\nIts on me and I cant let him down\nBefore I stepped out the house\nMy niece said Make sure you come back again\nThen I started thinking bout the hearts that I broke\nPraying that the karma dont come back on them\nWe spoke about everything\nAnd how his wifes tryna take everything\nAll the inheritance\nAll because he gave her a wedding ring\nSo God forgive me for the minor things\nCause youll risk everything when youre tryna win\nAnd I cant go back, but the more I move forward\nThe more I start losing the sight of things\nDream chasing\nStuck between a rock and a hard place\nCalling it overthinking, obviously\nHow can I do it if I try?\nI should have known it

lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep\nAlthough my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any\nClock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many\nAlthough my eyes are heavy, they wont be closing soon\nCause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true\nWe make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths\nTo see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves\nI say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme\nSo I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine\nCause real recognise real is what my father says\nAnd Ill be sticking to this phrase until I pass away\nOverworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow\nBut Ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close\n5 oclock with lights off, interview with a vampire\nSleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require\nI swear I said, that Ill sleep when Im dead\nWhos on the beat upon the feature with Ed?\nIts D-E-V to the Zed\nOver tired, pale faced like Michael Myers\nBags underneath my eyes can show the baggage Ive acquired\nAnd over the time within this maze I think youll find youll\nNever find that peace of mind you seek to find until youre dying\nCause I got too much to stay awake for\nTo sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, its time to wage war\nScissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives\nTwo psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight\nIm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line\nVillans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes\nBe wide awake just like youre snorting lines\nOr get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times Im living in\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times Im living in lately\nI brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth\nAnd the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out\nDeliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those\nThat hate me call me Ron but they wont slither in too easy\nBelieve me Im snake minded, be within this great time, be\nOn minimum wage, life is a prison escape that Im in\nIts all to do with timing not the label that you sign with\nThen my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in\nI try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows\nSome of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone\nIm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro\nLiving out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow\nOpposite of sober cause I never did my homework\nWhich has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older\nI played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie\nI wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die \nTwo guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge\nMaking metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes\nAnd if we got our eyes on you, well catch you while you snooze\nTimes elapsing while youre catching Zeds, the masses like to move\nWe scan the situation, analyse information\nAnd then decide what probably is most practical to do\nDriven young gentlemen, Ive hardly changed my bed sheets\nAt all over the last 12 months cause I havent slept in em, true\nIm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so Im correcting em\nWe got the fans all like, Oh wow its Devs and Ed\nWhat less did you bloody expect from em?\nIn the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment\nFighting through writers block from 9 oclock to 5 oclock\nAnd no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got\nI keep my pupils engaged\nLike a classroom in holy matrimony, but Im only trying to stay awake\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times Im living in\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times Im living in lately\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times Im living in\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a

even think it knows that its pregnant\nStuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception\nLooking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking how come I didnt even get a mention?\nShocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension\nI signed to music for twenty-three years, now Im wondering why it doesnt want an extension\nIm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension\nNow Im on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception\nAh, no bars, get it?\nNow Im choking, no bars, get it?\nIt turned cloudy, no stars, get it?\nI hit the ground so hard, headache\nAh, its mad\nI should be proud right now but Im sad\nCause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad\nIm out of touch, in a cold December\nNow\nKeep Me Warm\nIm out of sight\nWith all these things Ive done\nDont hold me down\nIts more than I can take\nNow\nIm out of sight\nIn a cold December\nUh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them?\nI didnt know I broke up with my girlfriend til I saw her with someone else in Beckton\nI text her, you dissed it. She dont reply like its none of my business\nMy mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit\nWhyd you do me so wicked? Something mustve happened, how did I miss this?\nLove turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness \nNow Im powerless. Probably why Im fascinated with Misfits\nI guess Im single, not happy, cause my heart doesnt feel like triplets\nAh, FREE, nobody understands but me\nI dont think I got no-one but myself, so when Im broke I still say I got P\nAh, its mad.

pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality\nSo many turning their back on me\nIts slowly coming back to me\nAll I can see is the word tragedy, but I didnt think there was a fatality\nUh, damn, I think I know why I dont see my dad\nI think I know why my mum walks past\nAnd why me and my girlfriend dont chat\nSee, all this time I thought I was mad\nI know why Im not proud and why Im sad\nIm out of sight and touch, cause back in March I dont think I survived that crash\nIm out of touch, in a cold December\nNow\nKeep me warm\nIm out of sight\nWith all these things Ive

ringing\nFighting for life, cant tell if Im winning\nOne of the worst situations Ive been in\nI could hear all of the angels singing\nBut when they stopped humming\nMy brain turned on, started running\nStill in pain, but it started numbing\nThe stone cold comeback I made was stunning\nI still tried to do a few shows cos I didnt wanna tell them that I werent coming\nBut I was left with a permanent problem\nNobody knows about the pain that Im in \nEver so cunning\n6 weeks later, jogging and running\nI used the first aid kit like a drum set\nPicked up the tools and I gave it a drumming\nTrust me, when it comes to mistakes\nYou cant afford to let one in\nNever done tunes for a while\nThe pipeline was blocked\nSo I learned and done a bit of plumbing\nThey say tomorrow never dies\nBut they forgot to tell you, you can\nYou can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang\nBut when your times up, thats it, its you fam\nYou can try beg for another\nSometimes Ill be on my way to a show\nThinking I just wanna see my brother\nThen do a U-turn, Im gone, one up\nTo see my family\nAnd keep it inside\nDry eyes, while my brother weeps\nSave my soul5Embed", "Make Me Better Lyrics\nYou

hoping for a fairytale too\nAnd if your DVD breaks today\nYou shouldve got a VCR\nBecause Ive never owned a blue ray, true say\nI know Ive always been shit at computer games\nBecause your brother

in my hand\nAnd Ill carve it like this necklace\nSo the heart falls where your chest is\nNow a piece of me is a piece of the beach\nAnd it falls just where it needs to be\nAnd rests peacefully\nSo you

life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you\nI gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam\nYou came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man\nCold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels\nPlus racists full of hatred in your own plant\n3 jobs in a day\nRest in life in you working but you were never stress free\nJust locked in a cage slaving\nThey said they were gold in the pavements\nBut you came and saw the road to amazement\nBroke your heart\nBut still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast\nI hope your listening right\nI still think of you every Sunday\nNo one can top your chicken and rice\nEven through the darkness times\nYou held us all up because your vision was bright\nI knew your strength was your wisdom inside\nYou never let anyone see your heartache\nYou just got on with it\nAnyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful\nAnd your words you would stand strong with it\nCause they were like warmth on a winter night\nBut I was just too young to go on with it\nAnd there somethings I could try to do\nBut its an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you\nI couldnt do that, I owe my life to you\nAnd of the pieces of my soul\nYou know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one\nI can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air\nAnd will you think of me up there?\nCan I say goodbye to you?\nAnd paint the stains of the teardrops down my face\nOr feel the chill of your warm embrace?\nCan I say goodbye to you? Ohh\nI think you phoney\nI was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now\nI would be by your side when you needed me\nInstead of asking you Nan can I go out?\nStanding in a road with the gangs that I know now\nEveryones missing you loads, Jessicas grown up\nWarreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and Im living with hope\nIts been a while since Ive seen C and the mouths\nI miss seeing a family, being a family\nAnd us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child\nBut as time goes by, the bridge seems longer\nFamily problems have never been funny\nIn my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia\nShe took all our inheritance money\nLeft the rest of us to pick up the pieces\nI never forgive the way she betrayed us\nThere aint a big enough reason\nBefore I sell out my fam Ill be giving up breathing\nBut I guess that everyones different\nOr should I say no ones perfect?\nShe had happiness in front of her\nBut chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing\nSince you gone the foundations crumbled\nSo building it back up is my next step\nI got all the bricks and the cement but\nIts hard when its done, I dont know what to expect\nSo give me the strength that I need to perform this task\nMake it right, I must do\nAnd I ask cause I trust you\nIt goes way beyond a song when I say I love you\nAnd of the pieces of my soul\nYou know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one\nI can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air\nAnd will you think of me up there?\nCan I say goodbye to you?\nAnd paint the stains of the teardrops down my face\nOr feel the chill of your warm embrace?\nCan I say goodbye to you? Ohh\nIts just for now so I should hush\nIll never get enough, Ill see you when I see you but\nI miss you, oh how I miss you\nIts just for now so I should hush\nIll never get enough, Ill see you when I see you but\nI miss you, oh how I miss you\nThere aint enough words to describe\nHow sorry I am for the pain that I caused\nSorry for when I stuck up my own blood\nWe were young and he said it was raping his broad\nAnd for the day police came to the door\nIm sorry for being such a bad youth\nStealing from your purse and making you mourn\nI never been able to say this before\nCause I was so inconsiderate\nYou loved me unconditionally\nAnd I took advantage of it like a idiot\nNot seeing the pure soul that I was living with\nI really hope that you can forgive me\nYou going away was a punishment\nBut I wont let go Im holding you with me\nBut I still fight the emotions within me\nI can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air\nAnd will you think of me up there?\nAnd can I say goodbye to you?\nAnd paint the stains of the teardrops down your face\nFeel the chill of your warm embrace?\nAnd can I say goodbye to you?\nI can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air\nAnd will you think of me up there?\nCan I say goodbye to you?\nAnd paint the stains of the teardrops down my face\nOr feel the chill of your warm embrace?\nCan I say goodbye to you?6Embed", "Amo soltanto te

Lyrics\nWhen I was six years old I broke my leg\nI was running from my brother and his friends\nAnd tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down\nI was younger then, take me back to when I\nFound my heart and broke it here\nMade friends and lost them through the years\nAnd Ive not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know Ive grown\nBut I cant wait to go home\nIm on my way\nDriving like 90 down those country lanes\nSinging to Tiny Dancer\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and its real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nOnce we got older, hoping the fun never ends\nRunning down the road through the back fields and hanging out with my friends\nHad my first job on a Friday night, I dont reckon I did it right\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\nWed buy cheap toys and then theyd break\nMe and my friends have not hung out in so long, oh how weve grown\nBut I cant wait to go home\nIm on my way\nDriving like 90 down those country lanes\nSinging to Tiny Dancer\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, its real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\nAnd Im on my way, I still remember\nThese old country lanes\nWhen we did not know the answers\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, its real\nWe watched the sunset

when it’s late\nAnd sirens bleed through my windowsill\nI can’t close my eyes\nDon’t control what I’m into\nAnd this tower is alive\nThe lights that blind keep me awake\nMy hood up and lace untied\nSleep fills my mind\nDon’t control what I’m into\nLondon calls me a stranger, a traveller\nThis is now my home, my home\nI’m burning on the back street\nStuck here sitting in the backseat\nAnd I’m blazing on the street\nWhat I do isn’t up to you\nAnd if the city never sleeps then that makes two\nThe pavement is my friend\nIt will take me where I need to go\nSo I find it trips me up\nAnd puts me down\nThis is not what I’m used to\nAnd the shop across the road\nFulills my needs and gives me company\nWhen I need it\nVoices speak through my walls\nI don’t think I’m gonna make it\nPast tomorrow\nAnd London calls me a stranger, a traveller\nThis is now my home, my home\nBurning on the back street\nStuck here sitting in the backseat\nAnd I’m blazing on the street\nWhat I do isn’t up to you\nAnd if the city never sleeps then that makes two\nAnd my lungs hurt\nAnd my ears bled\nWith the sound of the city life\nEchoed in my head\nDo I need this\nTo keep me alive?\nThe traffic stops and starts, but I\nNeed to move along\nI’m from a city where the rain won’t cease\nPollution in the air matches that on the street\nThe black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like\nWalking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like\nI was a country boy when I moved out\nGrew up too fast for my family to find out\nNow I try to stop my music running into nosedives\nCan’t resort to arrogance with white lies\nThis city won’t erase me\nBut I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me\nIt’s all the same see, music is my life, but\nNow I try to fight whatever I need to hide from\nNorth, South, East, West, London’s my home now\nKnees weak, but we never slow down\nNow I start to do my music properly\nAnd stay from all the negative shit that will follow me\nAnd London calls me a stranger\nThis is not my home, home\nBurning on the back street\nStuck here sitting in the backseat\nAnd I’m blazing on the street\nWhat I do isn’t up to you\nAnd if the city never sleeps then that makes two\nBurning on the back street\nStuck here sitting in the backseat\nAnd I’m blazing on the street\nWhat I do isn’t up to you\nAnd if the city never sleeps then that makes two1Embed", "Candle in

sister has to babysit, thats just a way it is\nDreams you own, just set your goals\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\nYoull never make it as a follower, youll never know\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow cause\nI dont care what you choose as fact\nIm gonna take myself to the moon and back\nIn my dreams\nMy dreams\nMy dreams\nMy dreams\nStraight up me to the sand,

You see, a few years ago, we staged a race across London. We used a car, public transport, bicycle and a speedboat, down the River Thames. And it was one of our more genuinely interesting tests.\nHammond: Yeah, it was, but its always troubled us, because the bicycle, ridden by me, won. And the car, which is the whole point of this show, came home stone-dead last.\nJeremy: Thats cos he was driving it.\nMay: Well, yeah. It wasnt entirely fair, was it? The car I had was a gigantic Mercedes off-roader. Its not really suitable for London traffic.\nJeremy: Yes, whatever, OK? We decided we would re-run the race, only this time, wed use a car that was a little more suitable for city centre work.\nMay: Absolutely, the question now, though, was, which city? Because wed already done London, obviously. So, Jeremy got a map and a pin and because hes very tall and he has monkeys arms THAT is where we ended up.\nMay: This is St Petersburg, in Russia - the most northerly big city in the world. And this is the car Ill be using.\nQUACKING\nMay: This is the two-seat Renault Twizy. It costs just Â£7,000 and its an all-electric car, designed specifically for the narrow streets of Europes cities. With this, I cant really lose.\nHammond: Yes, he can, because I shall be using this Its the same sort of bicycle that Chris Froome used in this years Tour de France. Now, it is expensive. Â£9,000. Its Â£2,000 more than Jamess car. Its a lot for a bicycle, but its made of special carbon fibre, so it weighs just 860 grams. I love this thing. Every detail, its just Look at that, its magnificent.\nMay: Morning.\nHammond: Special.\nMay: Nice.\nHammond: Yeah, Id say.\nMay: Bloody hell! ~ I know! ~ Thats amazing.\nHammond: Yeah.\nJeremy: Yeah. Not good for you, Im afraid, Hammond. Ive got some medical research here. That racing saddle will put between 25% and 40% of your body weight on your perineum, which is the bit of you between your anus and your scrotum. And, as a result, blood oxygen levels in surrounding areas ~ will drop by 80%.\nHammond: What are you saying? ~ I just Medical advice - cyclings good for you.\nIts healthy ~\nJeremy: Wrong! ~ .\nHammond: gets your lungs working, non-impact.\nJeremy: Totally wrong.\nHammond: Good for your cardiovascular system ~ See.\nJeremy: Bad for your chap.\nHammond: My what?\nJeremy: Your chap. Uh, honestly, listen to this. Cyclists aged over 40 are considered at greater risk of erectile dysfunction.\nMay: Yes, thank you, Dr Clarkson. Thats fascinating. What about The Stig?\nJeremy: Oh, hes just on public transport, as before, yeah.\nMay: And you?\nJeremy: Well, now, you see, last time, as you know, I used a speedboat to go across London, but at the end, it couldnt go on land, so I had to run, which cost me the race. This time, however, Ive chosen a boat that can.\nHammond: Hang on a minute, isnt that a hover-van? ~\nMay: It looks like a hover-van.\nHammond: Well, it is.\nJeremy:Well, listen, gentlemen, most people laughed at our idea, when we went on the River Avon in ours, but the Russians have taken ~ our idea and put it into production! ~ Hammond: Its a hover-van.\nJeremy: Its a hover-van!\nTRIUMPHANT CLASSICAL MUSIC ~\nJeremy: Are you feeling proud? ~\nHammond:I This is fantastic.\nJeremy: Gull wing doors. We didnt think of that.\nHammond: Its got a proper dashboard!\nJeremy:I know. Its from a Lada.\nMay: It really does look like a van.\nJeremy: It is a van.Its got Lada engines, two of them, 72 horsepower, reliable.\nHammond: 72 horsepower?\nJeremy: Each.\nHammond: How do you operate it?\nMay: Yeah, what do those two pedals do? Jeremy: These?\nHammond: Yeah.\nJeremy: Pitch.\nMay:What pitch?\nMay: Of?\nJeremy: Propeller pitch.\nHammond: How do you steer it, with the wheel?\nJeremy: Ah, no.\nYes.\nHammond: No, yes?\nJeremy: When youre going quickly, this ~ As you can see, Im turning the rudders, yes? ~ Yeah. But that doesnt work at slow speed.\nHammond: How do you steer it at slow speed?\nJeremy: With pitch.\nMay: So, if youre trying to turn tightly at low speed, when your rudders arent very effective Yeah. do you use differential throttle or differential pitch?\nHammond:\nJeremy: Yes, I\nMay: So, which do you do?\nJeremy: Both.\nHammond: Are there instructions?\nJeremy: Yeah, all in Russian.\nHammond: So, youre going to race us in a hovercraft, with a fraction of the power, anyway, of the one we built, plus, with controls you dont understand, and the instructions are in Russian which you dont speak.\nJeremy: With my confidence brimming, it was time to prepare for our important race.\nHammond: If Id come out and my bike had been nicked, then, Id have been furious.\nJeremy: Wed start at the Vostochny Yacht Club and, from there, wed race for 18 miles, all the way across St Petersburg, to the finish line on Yelagin Island, outside a palace called Yelagin Ums-struss-struss-gids\nJeremy: Thats all in Russian. Thats all in Russian.\nHammond: Right, this is it. Goodbye, Stig. Forward into glory.\nMay: Here we go, defending the honour of the car, sort of.\nJeremy: I dont know what any of that means!\nHammond: Right, junction. Ive got my feet clipped in the pedals, I simply cannot stop.\nMay: Stupid boy.\nHammond: Wrong gear.\nJeremy: More power. Move! Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, Christ! Oh, no. Thats a rock, a rock, a rock. Well, were just going into those reeds and this does nothing. Back! ~ Its ~ BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP. Forwards, again, on that. This is Im busy, Im very busy.\nHammond: I think I saw a bump. Ow! Thats probably ruined my sausage a bit more.\nCHILDREN LAUGH\nJeremy: Bloomin heck! Oh da-da-da! Oh, God strewth! Now, its just going round in circles. Pitch, pitch, pitch. Right, now, I want to go that way. Christ on a bike! Im stuck in my own wake!\nMay: As my three opponents ~\nJeremy: Come on! ~\nMay: Well, two of them, settled into the race, I was getting to know my car. So, what is a Twizy, exactly? Well, its a metal cage, this frame, and there are plastic panels hung all over it. There are two seats, one behind the other, like a tandem. Underneath me is the battery pack. That powers a 17-horsepower electric motor, driving the rear wheels. Acceleration? Well, it cant actually go from 0-60 because its top speed is 50. But it does have a claimed range of 60 miles. And, as an extra treat . scissor doors.\nHave you got scissor doors, sir? No! Nyet!\nHammond: However, the Twizy is stone age technology, compared to my bicycle. I actually have electronic gears on this, so when I hit the button on the handlebars, the derailleur, the thing at the back that changes gear, moves across, with a Robocop-like noise. And to make the whole thing as streamlined as possible, its been shaped in Jaguars wind tunnel. It even directs the air around the front forks and around the drinking bottle, so it doesnt hit the riders shins, which are very unaerodynamic.\nHaha! Theres May.\nYes! RICHARD SNIGGERS Hammond, heres what Yee-hah!\nMay: Oh, God.\nJeremy: On board the only petrol-powered vehicle in the race . Id discovered the solution to my problems, as ever, was more power. If you go quite quickly, the steering works well. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now Im heading for the wall! No! Im in a power slide! Im doing a skid! Out of the way, birds, I cant steer! Stig, meanwhile, had finished with his tram and was now heading for the underground station.\nHammond: Were back in front. Its going to be like this all the way.\nJeremy: On the river, I finally had HMS Awkward under control. Come on, hover-van, catch the May! And theres another hover-van! My, theyre popular! Long way yet to go.\nHammond: 22 miles an hour. Keeping a bit in reserve. Long way yet to go Oh, really? Really?!\nMay: Overtakes a bicycle, with ease.\nHammond: Get some speed on. Oh, hang on, I think thats him. Oh, no, there he is.\nJeremy: Come on, van! That, I believe, is James May. Where is Hammond? I dont see There he is! Richard Hammond is in sight and hes behind me and slow! Seconds later, I also took James. Hahahaha\nMay: Cocking Nora.\nJeremy: Yes! Lets go win this race.\nJeremy: By this stage, Stig had found a metro station. And in this weird, subterranean world, he was distracted by many wondrous things.\nMay: Can I take him in that gap? Making a lane Yes! The interesting thing about the Twizy is, it is a genuinely small car. Its a genuine city car. theres a tram. I hate trams. Theyre trains running down the road. Trains cant stop. Whoa! Oh-oh-oh! Chuffin tramlines. Still, it could be worse\nHammond: Oh, no, dont want to go on the tram tracks! Im on the tram tracks! I dont want to Argh! Theres one coming in the way! ~ BLEEP.\n~ Oh! Argh! ~ BLEEP.\nHORN BEEPS BLEEP.\nHammond falls off bike\nAh.\nOh.\nArgh! Oh.\nOh.\nAh.\nHows my bike? Yeah.\nOh, thats not good.\nThe derailleurs come off.\nIts sheared.\nDo you know what? I think St Petersburg has beaten me already.\nWhen the news reached my colleagues, they were suitably saddened.\nMay: I mean, the one thing you have to avoid, on a bicycle, in a city with trams, is tramlines.\nJeremy: Sit-rep: the fruit and nut-powered Richard Hammond has not only ruined his testes, his penis and his anus, but hes fallen off! This is a proper three-way race to the finish now.\nINTERLUDE\njEREMY: James, hang on. James, how can you call this a car, when its got no heater, the boot is the size of a ladybirds clutch bag and the doors and windows are optional extras?\nmAY: Yeah, but I like it cos its simple.\nhammond: James, it cant even do 0-60.\nMay:Yeah, but its better than his hovercraft.\nJeremy: It is not! H\nammond: Well, its less deadly.\nJeremy: Hovercraft isnt deadly.\nHammond: Yes, it is.\nJeremy: Listen, Hammond, two points Number one, Im the only person in that race who is representing the Holy Trinity of oil, coal and gas.\nHammond: The Holy Trinity?\nJeremy: Yes, Holy Trinity.\nAnd number two, every single city in the world underuses its waterways. Theyve all got jammed-up roads, congested trains, packed buses and, right in the middle, a river with nothing on it, apart from a couple of ducks.\nMay: Thats because everyones terrified that there might be ~ somebody on it in a hovercraft.\nHammond: Well, yes, I agree waterways are underused, but the hovercraft is not the answer.\nJeremy: It is!\nMay: No, it isnt, so lets do the news.\nhammond: How can we do the news, when its over there ~ and were, all three, over here?\nJeremy: See, normally, we say, Lets do the news and, well, two of us do and ones over there. He starts it and then we join.\nMay: But if were all here No, we cant ~ Um.\nLAUGHTER\nMay: I know. While we and the cameras move over there, well show some footage of a squirrel.\nLAUGHTER\nJeremy: Right, the news LAUGHTER Sh, sh, sh, sh. And first of all, bad news, Im afraid, because Britains motorway network is going to get a new type of speed camera, which is grey and invisible. And unlike any other motorway speed camera weve seen in the past, this doesnt just come on when the limit is lowered for some reason, but its on all the time, constantly.\nMay: Really?\nJeremy: Yeah, constantly.\nMay: That is funny, cos I seem to remember the Tory Party saying they were going to end the war on the motorist.\nJeremy: I remember that.\nHammond: But you can end a war by brutally killing everyone.\nJeremy: Hertfordshire Police said, Its not in the public interest to tell anyone where the cameras are. So, fair enough, well pay the fine.\nI paid it into a bank account, but Im not going to tell you which one.\nHammond: Work it out, yeah.\nJeremy: Ill tell you the really bad news is that theyre already up and running in Kent, by the way, these cameras. Steve Harley, out of Cockney Rebel, has been busted by one of them.\nHammond: No!\nJeremy: Yes, hes 63 years old.\nHes eking a meagre living out of, lets be honest, only one hit single. And now, theyve nailed him.\nMay: How fast was he going?\nJeremy: 70. But somebody in a motorway control room, in polyester trousers, with appallingly-smelly armpits, had decided that the speed limit at that particular moment, for no good reason, should be 40.\nMay: 40?! 40mph on a motorway?!\nJeremy: Yes, that was the speed limit that was prevailing when he was caught.\nHammond: How much did he get fined?\nJeremy: £1,000.\nHammond: 1,000 quid, for that?!\nJeremy: But I have an idea. You know if you download a song? The artist gets 49p. Now, why dont we download, ~ Make Me Smile?\nHammond; I love that song.\nJeremy: Everybody loves that song.\nJeremy: You cant trust someone who doesnt like it. What are you doing, James?\nMay: Ive already got it, but I can delete it and download it again.\nHammond: Imagine everybody did it! Hed wake up tomorrow and realise, Im number one! ~ Where did that come from?! ~\nJeremy: He wouldnt know, if hes not watching Top Gear. Why am I number one, all of a sudden?! ~\nHammond: That would cheer him up.\nJeremy: And the great thing is if he does go to number one, hell have enough money to help other people out with their speeding fines. We could call it the Make Me Smile Foundation.\nHammond: Oh, thats a beautiful idea!\nMay: He could take out a small ad in the papers. He could say, Caught speeding? Come up and see me.\nHammond: It could work. Beautiful idea.\nJeremy: Now, Boris Johnson, who is a mayor, has decided he wants to make London an ultra-low emission zone. Thats easy, just get rid of all the buses.\nHammond: And hes back on his high horse.\nJeremy: No, cos this time, Im backed by fact.\nHammond: Are you, really?\nJeremy: Yes, I am, because the levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution are measured constantly in Oxford Street, right in the middle of London. Ive got the graph here from the week before last. You can see here. 7th, this is the peak. Yes, thats the 7th of January. the day of the bus strike.\nHammond; Yeah.\nJeremy: So, there you are. You want to save the world, burn a bus.\nLAUGHTER ~\nHammond: Let us move on.\nMay: Yes, lets.\nHammond: I think we should talk about the cars that were looking forward to ~ this coming year.\nJeremy: Good idea.\nMay: Yes.\nHammond: Tell you what Im looking forward to this year, coming up?\nMay: What? Lets have a look at it.\nHammond: The Ariel Nomad. Look at that.\nJeremy: Its just scaffolding.\nHammond: No, it is brilliant, is what it is. Its from Ariel, the same people who made the Atom, ~ the car that ripped his face off? ~\nJeremy: I remember it.\nhammond: It grew back, sadly, but this thing is, kind of, an off-road version of the same thing.\nIts got a 2.4 litre engine now and its got all those body panels there. Theyre made out of the same material they use for traffic cones and boat fenders, so that thing is indestructible.\nJeremy: Which is a pity.\nHammond: Its brilliant! I love it! Look at that!\nMay: Yes, but what are you going to do with it? Well, drive it about.\nHammond: You can drive it on the road. That goes on the road.\nMay: Yeah, but you can drive a tractor on the road ~ or one of those massive cranes that do 8mph.\nHammond: I like those, too. I want one. Im going to have one. Its brilliant.\nJeremy: You are like a rural simpleton, you know that?\nMay: What do you mean, hes LIKE a rural simpleton?\nJeremy: The car Im looking forward to driving this year ~ is a hybrid, actually.\nHammond: Is it?\nJeremy: Da-da! There you go. Look at that. Thats the new Honda NSX. Been waiting years for this. Its got three electric motors - one for each of the front wheels and then one at the back, to supplement the twin-turbo V6 - Â£100,000. But if you think about it, thats a tenth of the price of a McLaren P1. Thats just fabulous.\nHammond: I dont like it.\nJeremy: Thats cos youre a rural simpleton.\nHammond: No, it doesnt look right.\nJeremy: It does look right!\nMay: Is it exciting enough? No, I do like it. I think it looks great and sounds interesting, but I thought you would be more interested in this, the new Ford GT.\nJeremy: Oh, yeah.\nMay: Thats more you.\nJeremy: Nah.\nHammond: Why not? Id have thought that was No, I know.\nJeremy: Ive been there and Ive, sort of, done that, with Ford GTs. Theyll fit it with a burglar alarm that will go off every time you fall asleep or when your childs doing some important solo work in the school production - Woo-woo-woo!\nHammond: This is weirdly specific. Stuff that happened to you.\nJeremy: I know what will happen and then youll drive home and get a phone call from somebody, saying, Your cars been stolen. Youll say, It hasnt, Im driving it. We dont believe you. Whats your mothers maiden name? Did she like boiled eggs done for three minutes? I dont know. Were going to shut the engine down and youre at the side of the road and get hypothermia and then the alarm will go off again. No. And Im, sort of, done now, as you know, cos Im mature and wise, with mid-engined cars. That does look great, but just not for me. Now, thats nearly the end of the news, but before we conclude, I need to say something, actually. Im sure a lot of you saw the Patagonia Special and I want to admit, here and now, in front of everybody, I made a terrible, terrible mistake. Nobody knows Im going to do this - not the producers, nobody - but I want to get it off my chest. Right in the middle of the programme I said that the condor is the largest flying bird in the world. It isnt. Its the wandering albatross and Im deeply, deeply sorry.\nHammond: Well done for getting that off your chest. Feel better?\nJeremy: No, if you make a mistake, own up to it and move on! Fair enough.\nHammond: Right. Now, we must move on to this, the Lamborghini Gallardo. It is the companys best-selling car.\nIn fact, of all the Lamborghinis ever sold, over half of them have been Gallardos. Now, though, sadly, its gone and in its place, there is a new car.\nHammond: Here it is. Its called the Huracan, after a famous Spanish fighting bull. It costs £187,000. And its brand new, from the ground up.\nOh, well, thats a problem right there. I couldve sworn this car was bright green, but according to the options list, its Verde Mantis.\nOther colours available include Arancio Borealis, Grigio Nimbus and Marrone Alcestis. Hows a Premiership footballer going to get his head around that? Anyway to business.\nOh-ho! Besides having to take over the baton from the Gallardo .the Huracan also needs to hold its own in a game of top trumps against the Ferrari 458 and the McLaren 650S.\nTo do that, there are some very big boxes to tick.\nseconds which it is.\nTop speed needs to be around And horsepower needs to be around the 600-mark, which it is.\nAll of that is thanks to a heavily-reworked version of the Gallardos 5. 2 litre V10. And as those revs climb, the jackhammer choir really kicks in.\nThe Huracan also has a brand-new, state-of-the-art twin-clutch gearbox, which is superb.\nThats a good thing, because the one in the Gallardo was Well, it was crap.\nIt was awful! This, though, this is a joy.\nAnd theres more hi-tech weaponry at this cars disposal.\nIt has carbon ceramic brakes, as standard.\nThe back end is sculpted so it doesnt need a stuck-on rear spoiler for downforce.\nAnd, like most Lambos, it has a four-wheel drive system.\nBut not just ANY four-wheel drive system.\nIt has three gyroscopes on board, like you get on a fighter jet, and theyre busy monitoring everything thats going on.\nThey send all that information back to the four-wheel drive brain and it then decides how much power to send to each individual wheel.\nMy head hurts just thinking about how all that works.\nThe result is, you can corner at sensational speeds.\nIm glued down.\nThe grip is astonishing.\nIts almost undefeatable.\nIf slithering about is your thing, you can have fun in the Huracan Ye gods! but you need an enormous pair of gentleman balloons. and your own personal airfield to play on.\nAnd, for me, this is where the problems begin.\nThis Huracan has been designed, on the road, to feel tame and user friendly.\nYou dont get that special Lamborghini mentalist feeling, unless you are here, with an entire airfield under your wheels.\nAnd thats a bit of a heartbreaker, actually.\nAnd while were on it, theres another issue.\nAnd its a big thing.\nBasically - bear with me on this - its the looks.\nI know its bright green and low and theres a bull on the front, but I just dont think that the Huracan is special enough for a Lamborghini.\nLamborghinis should be jaw-dropping - thats why they make the best bedroom wall posters - and I just dont see it with this.\nI think the problem is, this has been designed to sell many, many times and to still look good in ten years time.\nAnd I think, for that reason, theyve played it safe.\nLamborghini, like every car company, has got to shift units to survive, but I think, with the Huracan, they have thrown the baby out with the bath water.\nIve had some good times - no, great times - in Lamborghinis, on Top Gear.\nAnd if the producers got my e-mail .\n.\nthere shall now follow a montage showing that.\nWhoa! This is just so exciting! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Thats absolutely brutal! Whaa-ha-ha! The most alive thing Ive ever driven.\nIts beautiful.\nNow, as a car, this Huracan is probably better than all those other Lamborghinis, but those cars are better Lamborghinis.\nThe other Lamborghinis made you feel special, even in traffic.\nThis doesnt.\nAnd thats a loss.\nWhat we have here is a Lamborghini that I respect for its engineering, but love it? Quiver at the very sight of it? Im afraid not.\nJeremy: This is annoying. This is really annoying.\nHammond: Why?\nJeremy: Because I completely agree with you, for once.\nHammond: Do you?!\nJeremy: Yeah. Its Lamborghinis should be mad and stupid and have rockets coming out of their exhausts. And this, I dont know, it just doesnt float my boat.\nHammond: I know, its almost as though they actually want to sell cars.\nJeremy: And that is idiotic. No, no, seriously, because you know James and I have always said that, ~ one day, well open a pub? And itll be the best pub in the world, specifically because we wont allow anyone in it.\nHammond: Not anyone?\nJeremy: No, nobody at all. Nobody. I know an accountant would say, Thats a ridiculous business plan, but it will be good, because it wont be cluttered up with people with smelly bottoms wanting scampi in a basket.\nHammond: Yeah, but whats this got to do with Lamborghini?\nJeremy: Because Lamborghini should be making cars that they want to make, not cars that their accountants think will make a few quid.\nHammond: Yeah, I think maybe the problem here is that Lamborghini is owned by Audi.\nJeremy: And would you drink in a pub owned by Audi? God, no.\nHammond: No!\nJeremy: So, would you drive a car designed by Wetherspoons?\nHammond: No.\nJeremy: No, I wouldnt do that, either. Anyway, weve got to find out how fast this goes round our track. And that means handing it over to our tame racing driver. Some say that his favourite football formation is 8-8-19. And while we were off air, his iCloud was hacked and now everyone in the world has seen his helmet. All we know is, hes called The Stig! CHEERING\nJeremy: And hes off.\nTiny bit of wheel spin and then the gyros and computers tell the four-wheel drive stuff to do its thing! Flying through the first corner, Stig really working hard at the wheel of Kermits wash bag.\nMUSIC: Weve Only Just Begun by The Carpenters Mmm, Stig enjoying a smooth serving of The Carpenters, there.\nNo dramas through Chicago.\nNow, Hammerhead.\nAll-wheel drive cars can push wide here.\nStig using a very delicate steer.\nNo whiff of understeer.\nJust flying round there and out the other side.\nSharing horizons that are new OK, Follow Through.\nA chance to really get the ten-cylinder hammer down.\nWow! Whatever Stig did during his holiday has made him extra committed.\nJust two corners left.\nTurning in, with precision.\nOoh, hes gone a bit sideways up to Gambon.\nSkates it through there and across the line.\nCHEERING AND APPLAUSE This is amazing.\nThis is truly amazing, because it did it It did it in 1.15.8, which means it goes right the way up there. Look at it.\nHammond: Wow.\nJeremy: Its quicker than the McLaren MP4-12C. Its quicker than its big brother, the Aventador. And that means everything weve been saying is completely wrong.\nHammond: Well, no, because I still think That IS good, but it would be better if it was slower, but had knives sticking out of the wheels.\nJeremy: No, youre right because this part of the board is where Ferraris and serious stuff should live and Lamborghinis should be here, ~ which, interestingly enough, is where the Gallardo is.\nHammond: Yeah.\nJeremy: Anyway, we must now put a star in our reasonably-priced car. Now there are many, many well-known Eds in the world these days. Theres Harris, Miliband, Balls. There is. But But my guest tonight is the best and the newest Ed of them all.\nLadies and gentlemen - hmm-hmm - Ed Sheeran! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE\nOoh, upcoming star, how are you? Ed Sheeran is here! RENEWED APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Hes here. Thank you so much for coming. Now, obviously, youre a massive global megastar now, but is it true, what, five years ago, you were busking ~ on the London Underground?\nEd Sheeran: No.\nJeremy: Did you ever sleep on the London Underground?\nES: Yeah, well\nJeremy: Ah, I knew there was something youd done ~ on the London Underground!\nES: No, it was Yeah, it was just I would, if there wasnt a place to stay, which, often, it was too late for me to call anyone for a sofa, I would stay out till about 5am and then get on the Circle Line and just, kind of, lean up, and then get up around 12 and.\nJeremy: And just go round and round, cos it is warm down there and\nES: Its great. Its great.\nJeremy: There you go, theres a top tip.And did you sleep in the heating duct at Buckingham Palace?\nES: No, no.\nJeremy: Theres another no.\nES: It was outside of Buckingham Palace, not in it.\nJeremy: This is what I find fascinating, cos five years ago, you were trying to find somewhere warm to sleep in London.\nES: People have really taken it out of context. The Daily Mail ~ have taken the quote and been ~\nJeremy: No No, I wont believe that the Daily Mail makes stuff up\nES: It wasnt, like, a massive hardship or anything. I wasnt living anywhere in London. I was sleeping on peoples sofas and sometimes they didnt have sofas to sleep on. It wasnt common, ~ but it did happen, yeah.\nJeremy: Cos you were gigging a lot in those days, ~ working your bottom off.\nES: I havent stopped yet.\nJeremy: Its still But you were travelling down to Exeter, to get ~ How much for performing in Exeter?\nES: That was the worst thing. It was an 80 quid train ticket to Exeter and I was getting paid Â£50 for the gig and I arrived and soundchecked with the sound engineer. He was like, Doors are at seven.\nGot to seven, I was on at 7.30.\nIt was empty.\nHe said, Wait 15 minutes, see if people turn up. Empty. wait another ten minutes. We ended up waiting an hour.\nNo-one turned up, so I just played to him. No, it was all right. And then I was, like, Cool, see you later, mate, got my Â£50 and went and Id missed the last train home. But Id just bought, from eBay, a Pokemon on the Game Boy Colour. And I just got that. So, I sat at the train station, until the morning, until the next train, playing Pokemon. It was great.\nJeremy: Its where you learn it all from. So, now youve got to the point from playing Pokemon on Exeter railway station, have you not just sold out Wembley for, ~ how many nights is it?\nES: Three nights.\nJeremy: Just you? In front of a crowd ~ of 80,000-90,000?\nES: Around that, yeah.\nJeremy: Does that make you nervous?\nES: I was more nervous about today, doing the lap. Genuinely, genuinely.\nJeremy: Cos I mean your whole life is Obviously, youve met De Niro now. Clinton?\nES: Yeah.\nJeremy: And then, today, you met James May.\nES: Yeah.\nJeremy: So, youve completed the circle. Can I talk a bit about your early life, before we get on to the cars, if we may? Cos I was slightly staggered. You had a number of illnesses when you were little.Not just your hair.\nLAUGHTER\nGlaucoma?\nES: It probably could have led to that. I had a big birthmark on the side of my face ~ that I had to get lasered off. And weird eyes.\nJeremy: Weird eyes. And you had to play sports wearing some\nEd: Well, my view on it is that I was a very weird kid in primary school and I probably didnt have a lot of friends, but, I think, God looked down and went, You need some help ~ and gave me a guitar and it worked out.\nJeremy: And here you are.\nES: Yes.\nJeremy: Good old God.\nES: The second half of my life is much more fun than the first half and Id rather that way round, because half of the popular kids in school, I mean, you know, are LAUGHTER ~ BLEEP ~ their lives up.\nLAUGHTER\nJeremy: Now, wed better get on, Im afraid, to the elephant in the room.\nES: Yes.\nJeremy: Um Ed cant drive.\nLAUGHTER\nJeremy: And I dont just mean you have no driving licence. Weve had that before, with Johnny Vegas and Jack Whitehall, more recently. But how much cant you drive? Or how much couldnt you drive before you got here today?\nES: Id never sat in the drivers seat or put my hand on a steering wheel. The reason I said yes to Top Gear is that I thought it would be funny, the first time that I drive.\nJeremy: It is This must be the first-ever televised driving lesson.\nES: I think so many 17-year-olds around the world would want The Stig to teach them how to drive and thats what happened.\nJeremy: I think it is very, very ballsy to come here, saying, I dont mind being filmed for my first ever lap. You have actually bought cars for people - ~ sound engineers and so on.\nES: Yeah, I bought Basically, every year I give people who work for me a Christmas bonus and this guy who works for me was, basically, every year, spending his Christmas bonus on things you should spend your bonus on - his family. But he would always go on about wanting a Porsche 911 Carrera. Oh, thats my dream car, but Im doing up the bathroom next, so this year, I just got him the Porsche.\nJeremy: You bought him a 911?\nES: Yeah.\nJeremy: Didnt you buy another sound engineer a Smart car?\nES: I bought my guitar tech a Smart car\nJeremy: ut that was another Whats he done wrong? How does he feel going, Oh, brilliant?\nES: I see these people, day in and day out, and they always talk about the thing that they want most.\nJeremy: Hes got really low ambition. We need to have a word with him. Are you sure hes doing your guitars properly? Cos if he thinks a Smarts a good enough car, when he could have said a 911!\nES: Its different strokes for different folks.\nJeremy: Youre right. Now, moving on to your lap. How was it out there?\nES: It was interesting. It was interesting. I had some very funny bloopers, which Im sure youre going to show.\nJeremy: We wouldnt do that. Yes, we would. Whod like to see Eds first-ever driving lesson on television?\nALL: Yes!\nJeremy: Weve got one or two clips wed like to show first of a few slip-ups. Lets have a look at those.\nSo this is Whoa, thats the second to last corner, but you missed that by a long way there.\nES: That looks great.\nJeremy: Oh, my God, is that the Follow? They go through the tyres! Youre not going to hold it. You did! Oh, wait, wait, wait! Argh! Not again, not again at the Follow Through? The same! What staggers me about that is, when the car is sliding, particularly going through there, which is about 80mph. So, its sliding like that. Most people just give up, but you, actually, were wrestling with the controls in there.\nES: That wasnt planned. I just didnt know to take my foot off the accelerator.\nJeremy: You just kept it on?\nES: Yeah, I wasnt, like, Im going sort this out and show everyone that Im really good at driving. It was, literally, just like Ah!\nJeremy: How do you actually walk about when theyre that big? Shall we have a look at the fastest lap? Everybody ready?\nALL: Yeah!\nJeremy: Play the tape. Come on. Here we go. Yes, wheel spin from an automatic. Oh, it is wet, isnt it? Yeah.\nES: Come on.\nJeremy: It will and here it comes. Down to the first corner and around it. Still cant believe that you had never driven a car before this morning. And youre around at Slightly wide, but never mind. Were off towards Chicago now.\nES: Come on, come on, come on, yeah. Yep, yep, yep.\nJeremy: Like it. Neat and tidy through there. No real problems, at all, and with tyre Yes, the tyres are squealing. Keep your hands on the wheel, that is important. And this is the Hammerhead, designed to catch out the unwary and the new. But it hasnt got you! Right, now, this is it. This is coming up to what we call the Follow Through, cos if you get it wrong thats what happens.\nEXHALES DEEPLY\nJeremy: Lifting? No, youre not lifting. Nobodys ever had tyre squeal on their first-ever driving lesson. Through the tyres, can he do this? Yes, looking good.\nOh, crikey, a little bit of brake action there or that could be automatic, on the cars part. Second to last corner, catches most people out, but not you, not today.\nInto Gambon And, oh, there was a burst of acceleration.\nAnd there we are, across the line!\nCHEERING AND APPLAUSE\nJeremy: Right, now\nES: It looked slower than it felt.\nJeremy: It does. Its not a fast car. There are faster ones available on the market.\nJeremy: Where do you think youve come on our?\nES: As long as I beat Jack Whitehall, Im happy.\nJeremy: Two things One - Jack had driven a car before he got here, although he had no licence. And the track was mildly moist for him, barely wet, but it was very wet for you, so it obviously slows you down.\nSo, he did a 1.54.5.\nAnd you, Ed Sheeran you were\nALL: Ooh!\nJeremy: 1.54.3\n~ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE\nJeremy: And in wet. Youve done it! Yeah. That is Are you genuinely amazed by that? Cos I am.\nES: I guess so, but, like, that one was the best time that I did it. And the times before that were probably about 2.30. So, um\nJeremy: Well, with that level of improvement, we should just give Ed a driving licence now.\nALL: Yes!\nJeremy: Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Sheeran!\nCHEERING AND APPLAUSE\nMay: Now, tonight, we are staging one of our important races, between the car, public transport, a bicycle and Jeremys rather fanciful belief that we should travel everywhere on rivers.\nHammond: Yes, we are racing across St Petersburg in Russia. And when we left the action, Jeremy was in the lead, in his uncontrollable hovercraft. James was second, in his tiny, electric Renault. The Stig was somewhere or other on a metro train. And I had fallen off my bicycle and broken it.\nJeremy: OK, this is good. Flat out on water.\nMay: Remaining range - it tells me it is 40 miles, thats plenty. Bit of a jink round him. Ho-ho! Youre probably thinking, Whats the point of that tiny little car? Look at the size of that road hes on. Yes. But were not in St Petersburg proper, yet. Were still on the outskirts.\nWhen we get near the middle, theres going to be a small alleyway, something built before cars were invented. Things wide enough for a horse. And then, I shall sweep to victory.\nHammond: The Stig, James and Jeremy were battling in what they thought was a three-horse race. But I had other plans\nHammond: So, you speak English?\nRandom: I do.\nHammond: And you dont speak English?\nRandom 2: A little bit.\nHammond; Can you interpret? Ive broken my bike. I fell off my bicycle. Can I borrow your bike?\nRandom 1: No.\nHammondL Oh, please. Im in a race. A hovercraft has gone past now.\nRandom 2: Im late, I have to go to my work.\nHammond: If we give you a lift to work, can I borrow your bike?\nHE TRANSLATES\nRandom 2: OK.\nHammondL Really, can we?\nRandom 2: Yes.\nHammond: Really? What a gentleman! As a producer took the kind young man to work, I was getting to grips with his wheels. OK, this isnt as fast as the other bicycle, Ill be honest. Im doing 16mph, instead of 22, and its killing me.\nMay: Hammond would have struggled to catch up with me on his Â£9,000 Tour de France bike, but on some clunky old piece of Russian pig-iron that hes borrowed from a local, hes got no chance, has he? Lets be honest.\nJeremy: On HMS Petrol, I wasnt worried about Hammonds recovery because my lead was immense! And I was going like a bat out of hell. Power. Right through the middle. But then, I hit the city centre. Got hydrofoils coming in at speed from the left and the right. Two ferries and a water taxi. Oh, my giddy aunt, theres one over there.\nBLEEP.\nHORNS BLARE\nJeremy: In traffic like this, the hover-van was a menace. Turn! Turn! Good God, Im totally out of control. Holy mother of God, turn! Turn! Turn! No! ~ Oh ~ BLEEP.\nNot very Im crashing into St Petersburg now. Power! Come on, hover-van. Oh, theres swimmers. Oh, please, turn. Please.\nMay: I, too, had reached the city centre, where the tiny Twizy would come into its own, in the ancient narrow streets. Oh, cock. The main roads were eight lanes wide . and the side roads werent much thinner. Small wonder there are no parking regulations in St Petersburg. Theres no need. Look at it. Could have done this in a stretch Lincoln Continental or a Hummer or something.\nHammond: Worse, worse. Just worse. I will not give up, I will not give up. And I think Im going to be sick.\nJeremy: Meanwhile, back on the river\nHORN BLARES\nHoly Moley!\nHORN BLARES\nAnd another one! In order to avoid death by hydrofoil, I decided to leave the river and use St Petersburgs canals. This is a canal, its what I need. They were much quieter, but there was now another problem. No, dont To get under the low bridges, I had to deflate the skirts. That meant coming off the power and coasting, which went well! Sinking. Sinking now. Oh, giddy aunt. Oh, Christ, this is lower, this is even lower. Two and a half metres, thats pretty much the height of the props on the back. No, no, no, dont rise up, dont rise up! Oh, my No, no, no.\nMay: In the Twizy, Id discovered that no matter how wide the streets may be, a jam is still a jam. See, look, small cars dont make any difference. If I was on the bike, Id be down there, but no car is narrow enough for that.\nHammond: While James sat motionless, I was now entering the city centre I can still do this. Oh. where I discovered that cyclists are completely invisible. Oh, youre not You didnt Honestly?! Not even an attempt, was there? Argh, wait for me, numb nuts.\nANNOUNCEMENT IN RUSSIAN\nJeremy: On the underground, Stig had noticed that many of his fellow passengers were holding on to strange things. And so, at the next station, he decided he should have one, too.\nMay: Im on the tram lines and in a traffic jam. Come on, come on, come on. Terrified that Ill see Richard Hammond turning up any second on his stolen mountain bike. Man stopped in the bus lane, looking under his car, probably for a cyclist hes run over.\nHammond: Dont worry about me, Im just a cyclist. Im just a pigeon. Dont you worry yourself, chum.\nJeremy: Like all cyclists, Hammond was becoming full of rage and aggression.\nHammond: Come on, really?!\nJeremy: Whereas, in my un-air-conditioned hover-van, I was becoming hot, bothered and stuck. Sweating. Sweating a lot. Not certain this was a good idea. I really am not. Oh, now, this one is tight. Lower. No, no, no, Christ. Bloody hell. Scary! No, no, no, no, no!\nMOBILE PHONE RINGS\nOh Not now, not now, not now! Im in a big problem!\nMay: What?\nMay: Oh, ~ BLEEP, ~ I should have actually gone to the right. Right, U-turn. Concentrate, May.\nHammond: Thanks to Jamess famously-poor sense of direction, I was now in with a shout, especially as I could take a short-cut through the Winter Palace.\nWow. Thank goodness James has got a Twizy to fit in this place! Little corner cut, thatll save me a minute or two. Water coming up, over the bridge.\nJeremy: In the hover-van, I was finally free of the canals and back on the now traffic-free river. Ive got a lot of time to make up now. Come on! Power! We were now entering the final stages of our race. And at this point, because all of us were all over the place, any one of us could win it.\nMay: Coming past. I can have that, Ill have that.\nJeremy: Whoa, heavy turn. Full thrust!\nHammond: I will not give up, I will not give up.\nCome on!\nMay: Really giving this thing the electric berries here. Buffeting!\nJeremy: That is 144 horsepower, right there.\nHa-ha!\nHammond: What the ~ BLEEP ~ hell, are you? You great gangly ~ BLEEP ~ knuckle ~ BLEEP, ~ greasy-haired ~ BLEEP ~ bag. ~ BLEEP ~ you.\nMay: Thats more like it. A narrow side street.\nJeremy: We can win this, van. Come on.\nMay: Come on, come on. Im very close.\nHammond: Ah. There it is. Theres the end point.\nJeremy: Where is this unpronounceable palace? Where is James May? Where is The Stig? There it is. Yes, there is the finish line! Oh, wait a minute, have I got to get up that bloody thing? I have.\nMay: Somewhere around here, Im looking for a big white palace.\nJeremy: Right, here we go! No! No, no, no, no, no. Stopping.\nHammond: Oh, God!\nJeremy: Its Hammond. Bloody hell. Ha-ha! Argh. Not again. Argh!\nJeremy: Please tell me, have I won? Oh, Christ, look behind you.\nHammond: Oh, Jesus.\nJeremy: Well, there we are. Proof that the car is ~ Is better.\nIts better.\nMay: Was worth it.\nIm afraid, even when its comedically small, ~ French and electric, its still better.\nHammond: Ive ruined my penis ~ and Â£9,000-worth of bicycle.\nJeremy: Yep. Ive just realised something.\nHammond: What?\nJeremy: Three of us are here.\nMay: Yeah, I completely forgot.\nHammond: Oh, hang on.\nJeremy: Where is The Stig? Where is he?\nMETALLIC CLANGING CHEERING AND APPLAUSE\nJeremy: James May has restored the reputation of the car. Thing is, though The thing is, though, if you dont want to drive around in a little Philishave, with optional doors, youll have to buy what came second, which, of course, was the hovercraft.\nHammond: Oh, no, hang on a minute. I would have won that by 20 minutes, ~ if I hadnt fallen off.\nJeremy: Yes, but you did fall off. Twice, in fact.\nHammond: Yeah.\nMay: In an 18-mile journey, you consumed two bicycles.\nHammond: I did, yeah.\nJeremy: All we learned from you is that youre a spanner and its difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from The Stigs journey.\nSo, in that whole film, weve learned absolutely nothing, at all.\nAnd on that bombshell, it is time to end.\nThank you so much for watching.\nSee you again next week.\nGood night!

you worry if I disappear\nI told her Im not really looking for another mistake\nI called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\nBut then I jump right in\nA week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause til the moment was right\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around 10\nBaby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\nWell be in between the sheets til the late AM\nBaby if you wanted me then

her\nNow shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha\nAll over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I dont want to either\nBut me and her we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes the same day ah\nThose shows have never been what its about\nBut maybe well go together and just figure it out\nId rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch\nBut we should get on a plane\nOr well be missing it now\nI wish Id have written it down\nThe way that things played out\nWhen she was kissing him how\nI was confused about\nShe

knows\nTake aim and reload\nI dont wanna know that babe\nAh lahmlahlah\nOn my hotel door\nI dont even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder\nI already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didnt need to take him to bed thats all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex of course\nIts not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realise what you wanted\nIts a bit too much, too late if Im honest\nAll this time God knows Im singing\nAh lah\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI dont wanna know

we used to lay\nAnd re: stacks is what the speakers played\nId be on tour almost every day\nWhen I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay\nJust watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed\nGetting high as two kites when we needed to breathe\nWe used each others air just for the people to see\nAnd stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep\nWed go anywhere, our minds would take us\nAnd I said you are beautiful without your make-up\nAnd you dont even need to worry about your weight cause\nWe can all be loved the way that God made us\nAnd times the only reason that we could break up\nCause you would always tell me Im away too much\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane\nOr make a mistake, say it again\nOh Nina\nYou should go Nina\nCause I aint never coming home\nNina oh, wont you leave me now\nAnd Ive been living on the road Nina\nBut then again you should know Nina\nCause thats you and me both\nNina oh, wont you leave me now\nNow\nAnd every weekend in the winter\nYoud be wearing my hoodie\nWith draw strings pulled tight\nTo keep your face from the cold\nTaking day trips to the local\nWhere wed eat on our own\nCause every day when I was away\nWed only speak on the phone\nWatching Blue Planet\nCreating new habits\nThen as if we were two rabbits\nAnd then youd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics\nI disappear\nYou call me selfish, I understand\nBut I cant help it\nI put my job over everything\nExcept my family and friends\nBut youll be in between forever\nSo I guess well have to take a step back\nOverlook the situation\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\nAnd Im not saying we should be taking a break\nJust re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and its too late\nSo we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane\nBut in a day well have to say it again\nOh Nina\nYou should go Nina\nCause I aint never coming home\nNina oh, wont you leave me now\nAnd Ive been living on the road Nina\nBut then again you should know Nina\nCause thats you and me both Nina\nUh wont you leave me now\nNow\nLove will come and love will go\nBut you can make it on your own\nSing that song, go, oh wont you leave me now\nPeople grow, and fall apart\nBut you can mend your broken heart\nTake it back, go, oh wont you leave me now\nOh Nina\nYou should go Nina\nCause I aint never coming home\nNina oh, wont you leave me now\nAnd Ive been living on the road Nina\nAnd then again you should know Nina\nCause thats you and me\nBoth in a road, wont you leave me

home\nWhere a man and his thoughts lived all alone\nHe tried to live, no effort was shown\nHe’s slowly finding a way back home\nHe had a nice family with smiles and frowns\nThey never could solve his way to be down\nCos he’s one dog who don’t want a bone\nHe’s slowly finding a way back home\nHe had a nice house with windows and doors\nHe said to his wife what’s mine is yours\nBut the seeds of deception are soon to be sown\nHe’s slowly finding a way back home\nHis children have left but the rooms are still there\nHis misses the noise and the scents in their hair\nBut far from the nest the babies have flown\nHe’s slowly finding a way back home\nHis wife was an angel sent from above\nHe never returned her kisses or love\nBut soon he’d found that she’d overgrown\nThis man who’s finding a way back home\nSo the leaves are all dead in this broken man’s June\nThe rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon\nHe stares at the floor, no more to roam\nHe’s slowly finding a way back

erase me\nBut I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me\nIt’s all the same see, music is my life, but\nNow I try to fight whatever I need to hide from\nNorth, South, East, West, London’s my home now\nKnees weak, but we never slow down\nNow I start to do my music properly\nAnd stay from all the negative shit that will follow me\nLondon calls me a stranger\nThis is not my home, home\nIm

return\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time, for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause\nUntil the moment was right\nI went away for months\nUntil our paths crossed again\nShe told me I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around 10\nBaby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\nWe´ll be in between the sheets until the late AM\nBaby

guess that I dont want to either\nBut me and her we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes the same day\nThose shows have never been what its about\nBut maybe well go together and just

hand-rolled cigarettes\nRunning from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\nHad my first kiss on a Friday night, I dont reckon that I did it right\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\nWed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\nMe and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how weve grown\nBut I cant wait to go

the planet\nI take it back now\nMmmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back love\nNo\nAnd take it back now\nNow I dont ever wanna be perfect\nCause Im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someones got to win worst dressed\nTaken my first steps into the scene giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\nCause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking absinth can change your mind state\nVividly need to let my liver be\nAnd Ill say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends\nIs good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\nCause that how its supposed to be\nIm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams\nBut, but I just write schemes\nIm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\nBut more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint of McDaid discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that well never betray\nThe way we were raised remembering our background sat down, thats how we plan it out\nIts time to take it back now\nMmmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back love\nNo\nMmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDont you fade into the back love\nNo\nVery superstitious, writings on the wall\nVery superstitious, ladders bout to fall\nThirteen month old baby, broke the lookin glass\nSeven years of bad luck, the good

street\nWhen it was cold outdoors\nAnd now Im sweating on the stage of a sold out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\nNever to make a hit\nYou cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nIm not a rapper Im a singer, I just take the piss and\nMost of these other guys are kids that Pulses\nLittle sister has to babysit, thats just the way it is\nDreams you own, just set your

no summer time\nStone Island jacket, keep warm\nAnd all phone lines are tapped, youve been warned\nAnd also mind the gap and keep calm\nCause one wrong move on the train, big beard\nAnd its gunshots,

a lie, and we follow in a line\nSo far back can’t see who’s leading them\nSome say that they believe but many don’t read what theyre believing in\nThe show is never over ‘till Tony sings in soprano telling us to breathe again\nGiving birth to any idea my mind conceives again I’m here to raise points\nEven if you don’t agree with them\nSome people are saying that men came from apes\nMany disagreed and a priest said Amen ‘cause if men came from apes then why did the monkeys stay the same then?\nSome scientists they lie and twist religions try to say\nYou know so much about the sky why don’t you try and make it rain then?\nMy moral is don’t judge a stranger before you judge yourself\nIf you love everything around you then you’ll love yourself\nSee I believe we’re one you don’t agree

baggage ive acquired\nAnd over the time within this maze ill think youll find youll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying\nCuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game\nIts time to wage war\nScissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives\n2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight\nIm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line\nVillans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes\nBe wide awake just like your snorting lines\nOr get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh\nThe times im living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be\nThe times im living in lately\nI brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth\nAnd the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out\nDeliver the raps how I flow\nI live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong\nBut they wont slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded\nBe within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in\nIts all to do with timing not the label that you sign with\nThen my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in\nI try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows\nSome of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone\nIm still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow\nOpposite of sober cos I never did my homework\nWhich has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older\nI played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie\nI wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!\nNever die\nDEVLIN\n2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge\nMaking metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes\nAnd if we got our eyes on you, well catch you while you snooze\nTimes elapsing while your catching Zs, the masses like to move\nWe scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do\nDriven young gentlemen\nIve hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i havent slept in them, true!\nIm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting em\nWe got the fans all like oh wow its its Devs and Ed what less did you bloody expect from em\nIn the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment\nFighting through writers block from 9 oclock to 5 oclock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got\nI keep my pupils engaged\nLike a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a

were making them up\nSo its surprising that I still get so surprised\nAt how amazing they are\nBut I grin like a fool when I hear your lyrics, man\nEven thought theyre throw-away lyrics that you wrote for fun\nI love the fact that Im your biggest fan\nBut I hate the fact that Im only the biggest cause Im the only one\nThe CDs outdated but I need you on my playlist\nSo I downloaded your 25 tracks to my iPod\nAnd they hurt me every time I make a journey\nTo play a gig where you should be the headline act\nYou can find me floating sky-bound\nWhen you tell me its my time now\nAnd if I never, ever find out\nYou will find me floating sky-bound, right now\nNow Ive got a few famous names in my phone book\nBut youre a mate before these friends and I know I should call ya\nI love your food for

of the best that ever lived\nEven when the list is in no particular order\nTheres no way youre giving me your share of the blame\nCause when you think realistically its fairer to say\nThat you quit the game but still remained ahead of your time\nThan it is to say that Mr Pane has left you behind\nYou should be way past my level with a career of your own\nThe worldll never know that youre the rightful heir to the throne\nCause Ill refuse to play you for the listening pleasure and then explain to them\nWhy my friendll never make a penny from entertainment\nYou can find me floating sky-bound\nWhen you tell me its my time now\nAnd if I never, ever find out\nYou will find me floating sky-bound, right now\nYou shouldve been the greatest ever\nIve never put a better playlist together\nThan the one with the 25 tracks\nThat I set as a benchmark whenever I rap\nIve got a friend who should be everybodys favourite artiste\nAnd nobody chosen him because they cant see\nThat hes

would wait\nBut then I jumped right in a week later, returned\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me, I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around ten\nBaby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin\nWell be in bеtween the sheets till the late AM\nBaby, if you wantеd me then you should have just said, shes singing\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI dont

takeaway pizza\nBefore, a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha, all over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I dont want to either\nBut, me and her, we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes, the same day\nAnd those shows have never been what its about\nBut maybe well go together and just figure it out\nId rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch\nBut we should get on a plane or well be missing it now\nWish Id have written it down, the way that things played out\nWhen she was kissing him, how I was confused about\nNow she should figure it out, while Im sat here singing\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI dont wanna know

already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next \nBut you didnt need to take him to bed, thats all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat \nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex, of course\nIts not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun, and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realized what you wanted\nIts a bit too much, too late, if Im honest\nAnd all this time, God knows Im singing\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is

COVER\nI met this girl late last year\nShe said dont you worry if I disappear\nI told her Im not really looking for another mistake\nI called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\nBut then I jumped right in a week later, returned\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around ten\nBaby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin\nWell be in between the sheets till the late AM\nBaby, if you wanted me then should have just said, shes singing\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI dont wanna know that babe\nDont fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI dont wanna know that babe\nAnd for a couple weeks I only wanna see her\nWe drink away the days with a takeaway pizza\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha, all over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I dont want to either\nBut me and her, we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes, the same day\nAnd those shows have never been what its about\nBut maybe well go together and just figure it out\nId rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch\nBut we should get on a plane or well be missing it now\nWish Id have written it down, the way that things played out\nWhen she was kissing him, how I was confused about\nNow she should figure it out, while Im sat here singing\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI dont wanna know that babe\nDont fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI dont wanna know that babe\n on my hotel door\nI dont even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next \nBut you didnt need to take him to bed, thats all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat \nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex, of course\nIts not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun, and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realised what you wanted\nIts a bit too much, too late if Im honest\nAnd all this time, God knows Im singing\nDont fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI dont wanna

training\nToo busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze\nMade my bed and thats where Im heading\nI fly straight with the best man I embed em\nMarried to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her\nNow Im taking control of my inception\nCause they try to hit misses with my direction\nSee they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike\nNot even Maradonna is gonna cry, Im awake at night\nThe haters know where the family lives\nTell me what I catch, but youre playing knock door ginger\nJust gonna lose a lot more, than I need it\nThey say sleep is the cause of death\nBut I hear shit because I am deaf\nGang signs Im N/A reading\nIm a CEO, man you suckers are next\nChorus:\nWhen the darkness creeps in\nI feel my nightmares watching me\nAnd when my dreams are sleeping\nI feel my nightmares watching me\nOh, oh, oh!\nI feel my nightmares watching me\nThey watching me! They watch me sleep!\nLet me go!\nI fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality\nAnd daydream about losing my sanity\nIve been rhyming forever got a blind flow\nSo I can see an off note with my eyes closed\nBut to achieve the dreams you cant doze off cos your dream a sleep\nI aint nodding off but Im nodding to the beat\nI be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep\nSee, all the dreams Im fonder\nYou placed me in the team insomnia\nNow, I Mr hard worker\nIn my nightmares I Mr cant turn up\nAnd I missed my chance worst luck\nTrying to hit women I Mr I turn up\nYeah, and I

time\nI was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine\nOur coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine\nAs we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night\nI walked her home then she took me inside\nTo finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine\nI swear Im gonna put you in a song that I write\nAbout a Galway Girl and a perfect night\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, Baby, I just want to dance\nMy pretty little Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\nMy,

do you want to drink on?\nShe took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun\nShe got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun\nChatted some more, one more drink at the bar\nThen put Van on the

for a beat\nOh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week\nAnd in this packed out room swear she was singing to me\nYou know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love

my type\nYou hold me down, and I protect you with my life\nI dont wanna hurt you, I dont wanna be\nJust another ex-love you dont wanna see\nI dont wanna miss you\nLike the other girls do\nI dont wanna hurt you, I just wanna be\nChillin on a beach with you right next to me\nI know what they all say\nBut I aint tryna play\nI wanna be your end game \nI wanna be your first string \nI wanna be your A-Team \nI wanna be your end game, end game\nKnew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older\nBoth sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders\nReputation precedes me, in rumors, Im knee-deep\nThe truth is, its easier to ignore it, believe me\nEven when wed argue, wed not do it for long\nAnd you understand the good and bad end up in the song\nFor all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease\nFor all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities\nIve made mistakes and made some choices, thats hard to deny\nAfter the storm, something was born on the 4th of July\nIve passed days without fun, this end game is the one\nWith four words on the tip of my tongue, Ill never say it\nI dont wanna touch you, I dont wanna be\nJust another ex-love you dont wanna see\nI dont wanna miss you \nLike the other girls do\nI dont wanna hurt you, I just wanna be\nChillin on a beach with you right next to me\nI know what they all say\nBut I aint tryna play\nI wanna be your end game \nI wanna be your first string \nI wanna be your A-Team \nI wanna be your end game, end game\nI hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldnt\nAnd I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put em\nReputation precedes me, they told you Im crazy\nI swear I dont love the drama, it loves me\nAnd I cant let you go, your hand prints on my soul\nIts like your eyes are glitter, its like your smile is gold\nYouve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks\nSo heres the truth from my red lips\nI wanna be your end game \nI wanna be your first string \nI wanna be your A-Team \nI wanna be your end game, end game\nI wanna be your end game \nI wanna be your first string \nI wanna be your A-Team \nI wanna be your end game, end gameEmbed", "Cold Water Lyrics\nEverybody

only get you mugged\nWhere I come from, burning weed, it is a blessing from above\nWhere I come from, yes, we bun it when we listen rub a dub\nWhere I come from, yes, we bun after we just-a make a love\nWhere I come from, yes, we bun it when the sun starts shine\nI blaze high grade weed all the time\nWelcome to Jamrock, camp whe the thugs dem camp at\nTwo pound a weed inna van back\nIt inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack, it inna yuh back pack\nAnd ah give yah girlfriend contact\nSome bwoy nuh know dis, dem only come around like tourist\nOn the beach with a few club sodas\nBedtime stories, pose

carpets, now Im on Arabian Nights\nCause Im young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height and I gone hyper\nNever be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah\nThe games over, but now Im on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track without a loop pedal\nPeople think that Im bound to blow up\nIve done around about a thousand shows, but\nI havent got a house, plus I live on a couch\nSo you believe the lyrics when Im singin em out\nWow, from day one Ive been prepared\nWith V05 wax for my ginger hair\nSo now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of\nWhat the future holds cause its another day\nClose, close, close, close\nIve still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with the cold flows\nIm back with the old jokes, in fact, you dont know\nTracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant\nYou cant keep up, youll get none, youre celibate\nMy flows developing, skin lacks the melanin\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\nDo it for the hell of it\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit\nI took what held me back with the women, then packaged the image\nPut in some content, then sold it back as a gimmick\nThe fact is this, Ill end up dating actresses\nWake up on dirty mattresses, I think Ill need to practice this\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\nWorlds on my shoulders, I dont even know what Atlas is\nHard bars sharp like a cactus is\nIm back to rapping, back to back cause Ive been practicing\nIm back to sing this, yes\nYou need me, man, sing it out\nYou need me, man, I dont

came and killed it for his fortune\nI dont mean money, I mean luck\nAnd now the clocks aviated and everybodys times up\nNothings what I had and everything is what I gave\nLike a sprinter near the finish line, fighting for his place\nKeep your diamonds and your chains\nI can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe\nCause I get respected while they get detested\nTold the truth, there aint nobody that done what Devs did\nIf you aint on the tune or Eminem or 59\nYou aint competition, just a fish, youre tryna bite a line\nSing it, you need me, man, I dont\nMake some noise for Devlin\nSing it, you need me, man, I dont need you\nYou need me, man, I dont need you\nYou need me, man, scream it out\nYou need me, man, I dont need you\nYou need me, man, I dont need you \nSway\nAll

from my brother and his friends\nAnd tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down\nI was younger then, take me back to when I\nFound my heart and broke it here\nMade friends and lost them through the years\nAnd Ive not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know Ive grown\nBut I cant wait to go home\nIm on my way\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\nSinging to Tiny Dancer\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and its real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nFifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\nRunning from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\nHad my first kiss on a Friday night, I dont reckon that I did it right\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\nWed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\nMe and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how weve grown\nBut I cant wait to go home\nIm on my way\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\nSinging to Tiny Dancer\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and its real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\nOne friend left to sell clothes\nOne works down by the coast\nOne had two kids but lives alone\nOnes brother overdosed\nOnes already on his second wife\nOnes just barely getting by\nBut these people raised me\nAnd I cant wait to go home\nAnd Im on my way, I still remember\nThese old country lanes\nWhen we did not know the answers\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, its real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on

first kiss on a Friday night, I dont reckon that I did it right\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\nWed buy cheap spirits and drink them

coast\nOne had two kids but lives alone\nOnes brother overdosed\nOnes already on his second wife\nOnes just barely getting by\nBut these people raised me\nAnd I cant wait to go home\nAnd Im on my way, I still remember\nThese old country lanes\nWhen we did not know the answers\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, its real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the
